Once I reached the area I made contact with Karen Lirot, she stated that she was working tonight for Uber and was dropping off subjects outside of Kilroy's Sports located at 319 N. Walnut street, Bloomington IN. Karen stated that the front seat passenger was starting to exit the vehicle when she noticed a black Mercedes SUV traveling south on Walnut. As the vehicle attempted to pass Karen it struck her 2006 Mercury SUV on the passenger side causing light damage to the vehicle. The SUV then continued south on Walnut then turned west onto 7th street at a high rate of speed. Karen's vehicle had a skid mark from the front passenger door to the back of the vehicle, her passenger side mirror was also broken.

While officers were responding to the scene, Monroe County Central Dispatch received 911 calls from Andrew Ducker who was at Lot 102 and Ozzy Vaught who was the driver of the pickup truck involved. Ozzy Vaught advised dispatchers that he was the driver that hit a person, however left due to the volatile atmosphere at lot 102 and believed that it was unsafe to remain there until officers arrived. Ozzy Vaught met Deputy Dillon at a nearby grocery store and cooperated with the investigation.EMS and Deputy Walls and Brooks arrived at lot 102 and located the male that had been struck by the pickup truck, Wade Osborne. Deputies and EMS personnel at lot 102 requested additional assistance due to the volatile nature of the other individuals at the property. During the investigation, cell phone video recorded by Andrew Ducker showed Wade Osborne standing on the front porch of lot 102 and Ozzy Vaught and Gage Vaught inside of a silver Chevrolet truck parked in the street. The Vaughts and Mr. Osborne were attempting to yelling derogatory statements at each other and challenging the other to a fight. Near the end of the recording, Mr. Osborne exits the porch towards the Vaught's truck. The camera is pointed towards the ground, however the truck can be heard moving and a loud banging sound is believed to be Mr. Osborne striking the rear driver's side of the truck bed. Moments later, the truck can be heard moving and people screaming that the truck is on top of Mr. Osborne.Evidence at the scene suggests that the Chevrolet struck Mr. Osborne and his Lincoln Town Car during the incident. The Chevrolet sustained damage to the driver side front bumper and the Town Car sustained damage to the passenger side doors and rear quarter panel.Additional information regarding this investigation can be requested through the Monroe County Sheriff's Office Records Division for Report # M19-00778."

Trailway Drive is a local county road that runs in a northern and southern direction and intersects with SR46 1000 feet west of the crash. In the area of the crash the roadway is straight with an uphill grade. The road conditions were dry.V2 (white 2017 Dodge Ram 2500) was traveling westbound on SR46 and was stopped in traffic. V1 (2016 black Honda Civic) was traveling westbound on SR46 and was unable to stop. V1 collided into the rear of V2.D1 (Amira Morgan) stated she was traveling westbound on SR46 and saw V2 stopped.

I observed minor damage to the rear bumper and trailer hitch area of V2. There were no skid marks on the roadway. No injuries were reported as a result of this crash.The crash investigation showed the primary cause of the crash is unsafe speed on the part of D1.

While enroute to the location I was informed by dispatch no plate information or type of vehicle was known. Upon arrival, I spoke with the victim Christopher Franck. Franck said he did not need an ambulance but was going to be taken for a medical check out since it is his work policy. I asked Franck what occurred. Franck said he was at the intersection of 7th Street and Woodlawn Avenue at the crosswalk. Franck said he was walking northbound to cross the street, and was in the middle of the crosswalk. Franck said he did not see any vehicles in the intersection at the time when crossing. Franck said the next thing he knew he was struck by a vehicle. Franck said he was unsure of what type of vehicle and didn't have any plate information. Franck said the driver was a female, blonde hair and around 40-50 years of age. Franck said the female driver exited the vehicle after the crash and asked a couple times if he was okay. Franck said he then told her to leave to her face, so he would not scream at her. Franck said the female driver then left scene. Franck said he did not want her charged for the accident. Franck said he felt the vehicle was traveling around 15mph. After speaking with Franck, I spoke with Kruse who was right behind Franck when the accident occurred. Kruse said the vehicle was southbound on Woodlawn Avenue, and turned to go eastbound on 7th Street. Kruse said he was unsure if the vehicle came to a complete stop. Kruse said he thought the vehicle was a possible SUV and silver in color, but had no further information. Kruse said he observed the female driver looking at her cell phone prior to the accident. Kruse said the female did exit her vehicle and ask if Franck was ok. After speaking with Franck, I took photographs of his injuries. Franck had scrapes on his left elbow, right, hand, and right knee. I then drove the area, and looked for cameras for potential video footage, but was unable to locate cameras where the incident occurred. I placed the SD card in a sealed and clear bag where it was placed into locked locker # 6. I then sent the IUPD evidence tech an email pertaining to this incident.

I arrived and met with pedestrian Craig Schildmeier, who advised that he had been walking eastbound on the sidewalk on the south side of East 17th Street, approaching the intersection with North Indiana Avenue. He said when he was about halfway through the crosswalk, a red compact car, which was driving northbound on North Indiana Avenue, rolled through the stop sign without stopping while turning left onto East 17th Street. Schildmeier reported that as the vehicle drove through the crosswalk, he attempted to avoid being struck, but the driver side mirror of that vehicle struck his backpack. He stated that impact with the mirror damaged the driver side mirror, spun his body counterclockwise and his left rear heel was then run over by the rear driver side wheel of the vehicle. Schildmeier fell to the ground as a result, but he observed that the license plate read ""693YUE"". He could not tell me what state the license plate was from, but he did note that the vehicle was a ""Zipcar"" rental car. Schildmeier advised that the vehicle was driven by a white female around 20 or 21 years of age with brown hair and glasses. After striking Schildmeier, he reported the vehicle drove west on East 17th Street and then turned north (right) on North Dunn. Schildmeier advised that he lost sight of the vehicle as it approached the area of North Dunn and East Varsity Lane. Schildmeier reported that he believed his left foot to be bruised, but he refused an ambulance and had a friend pick him up from the scene. I put out a description of the vehicle to dispatch and advised them to also provide that information to Bloomington Police Department. I then checked the area for vehicle, but was unable to locate it. I requested that dispatch contact Zipcar to attempt to gather further information. I was advised that the information would be passed to their security team, who would then contact IUPD. Jennifer Navarro, the driver of the Honda, called IUPD after being contacted by Zipcar. I spoke with her briefly by phone, then went to the Zipcar parking location near the intersection of East 7th Street and South Woodlawn, where I examined the Honda. The driver side mirror on the vehicle was intact, however it was of a break-away design that can fold towards the body of the vehicle then spring back into place. There were some very light scuffs on the driver side mirror that I attempted to photograph, along with a less than half inch abrasion on the inside of the driver side mirror that appeared to have been made by the mirror collapsing after an impact. The gas cap cover also appeared to be misaligned, but when questioned, Navarro said that damage was there prior to her renting the vehicle. When I interviewed Navarro at her residence, she confirmed that she was driving the Honda on North Indiana at East 17th Street around 0837 hours. She stated that as she came up to the intersection, she heard and felt a ""bump"" on the driver's side, but did not see anyone or any vehicles when she looked around. Navarro stated that she stopped at the stop sign, looked both ways and continued, turning left on East 17th Street as she assumed she had hit a bump in the road. Navarro was adamant that she did realize that she had struck a pedestrian and insisted that she would have stopped had she known. She advised that she would be happy to pay any medical expenses that Schildmeier might have as a result of the crash. When I called Schildmeier back to advise him of the results of the investigation, he informed me that he had just learned that his ankle was fractured as a result of the crash. I advised him that I would update the crash report accordingly."

Vehicle 1 (silver Toyota car) was driving northbound following Vehicle 2 (black Jeep SUV). V2 was slowing in preparation for a right turn from the right lane of northbound Walnut St onto eastbound 3rd St when V1 made contact. V1 showed damage to the front end and hood, while V2 showed damage to the rear bumper area. Neither driver was hurt and the airbags did not deploy on either vehicle. Both drivers denied treatment or a tow truck. Vehicles were moved from the lanes of traffic to a parking lot to conduct the crash investigation. Driver 1 (Hannah Bentz) stated that she had been driving north when the vehicle in front of her slowed. She stated that she tried to brake but ""just couldn't get stopped fast enough."" Driver 2, (Shea Slayter) stated that she had been slowing in preparation for a right-hand turn when she was struck from the rear.

As Desmond was leaving the area I asked him how he went off the road and he said he swerved to miss a deer.

There were also several circles in the grass where it appeared Desmond had made several trips around they yard, causing damage to the grass. I asked Desmond if he had consumed any alcoholic beverages and he said no. I administered a PBT and Desmond registered a Br.A.C. of (.099) %. At that point Deputy Greene took over the OWI investigation where he transported Desmond to the MCSO for further testing as the weather conditions were extremely cold and windy.

Rosegarten, who had been driving a rental car that was a black 2019 Nissan Versa. She advised that she was in the left (south lane) of East 3rd Street, which is a two lane, one-way street at this location, preparing to turn left (south) into the alleyway between Kinser Cleaners and TIS Bookstore. As she began to turn in, a vehicle was heading north out of that narrow alley, so she stopped to give them time to reverse. While she was stopped in traffic with her turn signal on and the rear part of her vehicle still in the left lane of East 3rd Street, a red Chevrolet Corvette came up behind the Nissan and sideswiped the rear passenger side bumper. Rosegarten advised that she thought that the driver, who she described as a white woman in her 50s or 60s with frosted blonde hair in a short, styled hairdo, continued westbound. Rosegarten instructed her son to write down the license plate, which he did. The license plate number he provided was 562AWD, which returned to a red 2000 Chevrolet Corvette. I examined the Nissan at the scene and noted two small abrasions on the rear passenger side bumper, with some red paint transfer. Rosegarten also stated that the force of the impact had misaligned the bumper, but it had popped back into place prior to my arrival. I provided Rosegarten with this case number and advised her that I would attempt to locate the driver. I had dispatch put out the vehicle and driver description, but no unit was able to locate that vehicle or driver. On 02/16/2019, I returned to work and contacted Margot H. Scholz, who advised that she had been driving on East 3rd Street yesterday around 1650 hours. Scholz said she did not believe she hit any other vehicle at that time. Scholz, who had since returned to her residence in Columbus, said that there was no prior damage to the Corvette. I asked her to go out to her vehicle and check for damage. She at first did not see any damage, but later confirmed that there was a small scratch near the driver side headlight. Scholz said she would have stopped if she had realized she had hit another vehicle. She was cooperative and provided her insurance information, which I added to this case. There are no charges for leaving the scene as this appears to have been unintentional.************************************************SUPPLEMENT**************************************************On the afternoon of 02/16/2019, I received a call from Margot Scholz. She advised that her husband, the registered owner of the Chevrolet Camaro, had come home and examined the vehicle. She stated that the area near the driver side headlight that she had told me appeared to be a small scratch had been examined and rubbed off by her husband and that he reported it to be dirt rather than damage. She requested that an officer come by to examine their vehicle. I contacted Columbus Police Department for assistance. They dispatched Officer Kummer (badge #248) who examined the Camaro and reported that there was no damage. I advised that I would update the report to include this information."

D1 also stated that he was sitting at the light at 10th and the Bypass waiting to turn left on toe Interstate 45.

D1 stated that he sped up to get past the car in the right lane to merge in to the one lane. D1 also stated that he was even with the back of V2 when it began its wide right hand turn. D1 stated that he noticed V2 turning and slammed on his brakes. This is when the V1 and V2 collided. D2 stated that he had his turn signal on to turn right and was making a wide turn since he had a trailer and did not notice V1 starting to go around him and was struck in the middle of the turn. There was minor damage to the passenger side of the trailer of V2. V1 had major damage to the drivers side.

The light was green for my direction (traffic on the Bypass). I observed a gray Honda Civic on East 10th Street turn right onto the Bypass into the immediate path of travel of my squad car without yielding as required with a red light. As a result of the Honda pulling into my path, I had to brake and swerve to avoid a collision. I activated my overhead emergency lights and siren and the Civic pulled to a stop blocking the outlet of East Eastgate Lane onto State Road 46. When I exited the vehicle to go speak to the driver, as I approached the vehicle, the driver took her foot off of the brake and the vehicle began to roll forward. I yelled for her to hit the brakes and put the vehicle in park, but she did not and the vehicle continued forward approximately 10 feet before running off the road and striking the stop sign pole facing west on Eastgate Lane. When I spoke to the driver, Chunling Han, she stated that she only had a Chinese driver's license, which she showed me. She did not have an English translation of her license or her passport with her. Han said she had been in the US for less than a year and had been told that she could drive using her Chinese license. Officer Pesa arrived to assist me. He said Han told him that she had rented the vehicle, a Zipcar, to practice her driving.

The call had come through Monroe County, who advised that the driver was a male subject with long hair and a hat and that the driver was walking away from the crash north on Old SR 37. The reporting party to Monroe County was James Yount. This unit proceeded to the scene of the crash at 5097 Old SR 37 and met with Sgt. Doug Hutchinson PE 7418 who had arrived before me. The crash was a single vehicle crash where V-1a Grey Chevrolet Impala bearing 2109 IN 410TEN registered to Daniel Adam Hartsburg had left the roadway and struck an AT&T utility pole 8711. The crash caused the pole to snap into two pieces and the vehicle was sitting on the stump of the pole. The driver had left the scene, and Sgt. Hutchinson had checked north of the scene for the driver with negative results. While waiting on the wrecker, Sgt. Hutchinson noticed a cell phone in the car that was ringing. Sgt. Hutchinson could see the telephone number that was calling and the name and he wrote it down. The person calling the phone was Regena Dixon 812-360-0365. This unit had the Post call that number back and obtain information on who owned that phone. The Post contacted me back and advised that Regena Dixon was on the phone along with Daniel Adam Hartsburg. I was advised that the telephone belonged to Daniel Adam Hartsburg, the owner of the car involved in the crash. I was further told that they were at 7230 Old SR 37. Sgt. Hutchinson and I went to that address and spoke with Dixon and Hartsburg.Regena Dixon 10-5-1958 (812) 360-0365 told us that David Jackson had shown up at her residence about 5-6a.m. this morning and let himself inside. Dixon stated that she called out and asked who it was, and Jackson replied that it was David. Dixon said that she got up and asked her daughter Cheyenne (28) where David was to which Cheyenne said that he was in the back bedroom playing video games with Adam. Dixon said that she later saw David in the kitchen when she went to get a drink and David told her that he had to get his tools today. Dixon told me that Jackson resides in South Crest Trailer Park near the back of the park.When we spoke with Daniel ""Adam"" Hartsburg DOB: 08-24-1974 TX 812-947-8715 he told us that David Jackson had come to his residence 7230 Old SR 37 Bloomington, IN this morning and that Jackson had come into Adams room to fix an entertainment center. Adam told us that Jackson had asked Adam for a ride to work, and that Adam had told Jackson that he could borrow Adams car. Adam further stated that they give Jackson rides because Jacksons license is suspended. When asked, Adam stated that he does not have insurance on the vehicle he loaned to Jackson. Adam described Jackson as a male with long hair and wearing a toboggan hat, which matched the description of the driver the reporting party saw leaving the scene of the crash. Adam said that Jackson worked for a man named Scott, who sub-contracts with Midwest Roofing. Regena Dixon was able to provide a telephone number for Scott of 812-720-0042. Adam did not fit the description of the driver that left the scene according to the reporting party. This unit did not observe any injuries to Adam consistent with being in a car crash.This unit then went to 1206 S. Nancy Street Bloomington, IN and spoke with Scott McCormick, Jacksons boss, who advised that Jackson was supposed to pick up another worker and bring him to the job site with him. Scott said that Jackson had not shown up for work and had not picked up his co-worker either. I showed Scott a BMV photo of Jackson, and Scott affirmed that it was in fact the same David Jackson that did not show up for work today.On March 4, 2019 this unit met with David Jackson in the parking lot of Wendy's restaurant located at the corner of Walnut Street and Rhorer Road.

As she did so, the passengers in her vehicle began to scream at her to stop because of a pedestrian, but Adeosun said she was unable to stop before hitting the pedestrian, Aline Irankunda, with her vehicle. Irankunda stated that she had been walking west on the sidewalk on the north side of East 7th Street and had just begun to cross southwest from the northeast corner of the intersection when Adeosun's vehicle struck her. Irankunda was unsure what part of the vehicle hit her, but she complained of pain and had bleeding and trauma to her left jaw and side of her face from being struck. She also stated that she had a brief loss of consciousness. Adeosun was also unsure of what part of the vehicle struck Irankunda, but from the scene, it was most likely somewhere on the front bumper. Irankunda was transported from the scene by IU Health Bloomington Hospital Ambulance Service for immediate medical attention.

Upon further investigation, I was advised that at three car accident had just occurred and that one of the vehicles had left the scene.I first spoke with Driver 2 (D2) who advised that she had the green light and was heading eastbound on 2nd street after being stopped at the intersection of S Walnut Street. D2 reported that as she went into the intersection a maroon van (V1) heading northbound on S Walnut Street disregarded the red light and hit her vehicle (V2). D2 advised that after V1 hit her that V1 left the scene heading eastbound on 2nd street. D2 explained that she did not see the driver or anyone in V1 due to the accident happening so quickly. I then requested that D2 pull her vehicle into the parking lot at Big Red Liquors in order to get out of the roadway. I then spoke with Driver 3 D(3) who advised that he was stopped facing westbound on 2nd Street at the intersection of S Walnut. D3 advised that as V1 hit V2 that V1 also immediately hit the front passenger side of his vehicle (V3). D3 described V1 to be a maroon van. D3 advised that he could not see the driver of V1, but reported that there was an African American male wearing dark clothing in the passenger seat. D3 reported that V1 then continued eastbound on 2nd Street without stopping. V3 was already in the Big Red Liquors parking lot when I arrived on scene. I then spoke with several witnesses on scene. W1 advised that she was two cars behind V2 on 2nd Street when the accident occurred. W1 reported that as V2 got the green light and entered the intersection that V1 ran the red light heading northbound on S Walnut Street. W1 advised that V1 hit V2 on the front passenger side of the vehicle. W1 reported that V1 then proceeded to leave the scene heading eastbound on 2nd Street. W2 advised that he was in the parking lot area of Sahara Mart when he witnessed the accident. W2 stated that he observed V1 heading norhtbound on S Walnut Street when it struck V2. W2 stated that V1 then rode onto the curb by Big Red Liquors and proceeded East on 2nd Street. W3 advised that he was in his vehicle at Walnut Street and 2nd Street when he observed V1 drive eastbound on 2nd through a solid red light and hit several vehicles. It should be noted that it is believed W3 was confused about the direction V1 was traveling in. I was able to observe damage to both vehicles on scene. V2 had heavy front end damage on the passenger side. V2 had to be towed from the scene due to disabling damage. I then observed V3 which had damage to the front passenger side of the vehicle. It was able to be driven from the scene. I was able to take photographs of both vehicles. It should be noted that other officers were able to locate the maroon van. The maroon van had damage to it that is consistent with hitting the other vehicles.The driver has not been identified at this time."

V2 stopped just prior to entering the intersection on a green light in order to avoid being in the middle of the intersection in the event that the light turned red. Traffic was stopped ahead which is why D2 made the decision to stop at the intersection rather than continue into the middle of the intersection. D1 stated he struck V2 with the front portion of his vehicle due to his quick acceleration. V2 had been stopped in the left lane of the bypass for a red light at the intersection of Fee Ave and the Bypass traveling eastbound. When the light turned green, V2 began to accelerate to travel eastbound through the intersection. Traffic had slowed ahead of V2 so she began to slow to a stop so that she would not be stuck in the middle of the intersection in the event that the light were to turn red. As V2 came to a stop, V1 struck the left rear portion of V2. D2 stated that she did not stop suddenly but slowed to a stop instead."

D1, an Uber driver, stated he was dropping off pedestrian Ryan Blum near Blum's residence. D1 parked on N. Union Street approximately 150 feet south of the intersection of E. 10th Street and N. Union Street. V1 had pulled off on the east side of the northbound lane of N. Union Street to drop off Blum. D1 noticed Blum exit the rear passenger door of V1. D1 then started to use his cell phone to confirm a pickup of another Uber rider he was going to pick up. D1 did not know that Blum had got back into V1 to retrieve his belongings. As a result of not knowing Blum was still in the vehicle, D1 took his foot off of the brake pedal and ran over Blum's left foot by accident. D1 got out of the vehicle to check Blum's condition. D1 gave Blum his nickname of Kasey and his cell phone number. Blum then asked D1 to leave the scene and he did. Blum was admitted to the hospital at 08:08pm and was released at 09:26pm. X-rays were taken of Blum's left foot and the diagnosis was a deep contusion in his left foot.Blum contacted IUPD for a report of the incident on 04/04/2019 at 12:08am."

I69 is a divided 6-lane north-south highway, which connects Evansville and Indianapolis by way of Bloomington. The center median is paved with a permanent concrete barrier topped by reflectors, separating the north and south lanes of traffic. Both shoulders are paved and approximately one car-width, with the left bounded by the center concrete divider wall and the right lane bounded by a metal guard rail. The shoulder on both sides of the driving lanes are delineated with a white reflective painted fog line. The lanes of travel are divided by a broken white lines in this area. West Tapp Road, a 2-way paved city road, passes over I69 by way of an overpass approximately 1000 feet to the north of where the collision occurred. The roadway on the morning of Friday, March 29, 2018 was cloudy, with roads wet from earlier rain and mist. There were no signs of fluids or foreign substances on the roadway. Vehicle 1 (V1), was a blue 2006 International Harvester 2-door tractor (MI registration RA65675), pulling a flatbed 1995 trailer (MI registration C258089) containing a load of telephone poles. Vehicle 2 (V2) was a 2016 4-door blue Ford Fusion passenger car. Debris from V2 colliding with the center concrete barrier was present and scattered behind V2 on the inner shoulder of the highway. V2 had come to rest perpendicular to and facing into the concrete median on the inside shoulder, while V1 had come to a controlled stop on the outer shoulder approximately one quarter mile south. I made contact with both drivers and received verbal confirmation that neither were injured. Both individuals were standing outside of V2 when I arrived. Driver 2 (D2) stated that he had ""A little tightness between his shoulder blades' but was otherwise okay. Driver 1 (D1) stated that he was uninjured and that his vehicle had not sustained any damage. Both drivers refused medical treatment. V2 sustained damage to the entire front end, doors, and rear end. The rear bumper was ripped off and parts of the rear bumper and undercarriage were dragging on the roadway. The airbags did not deploy. The rear trunk and front left door were buckled, to the extent that neither would open. The windows and windshield were not broken. The portion of the rear bumper with the license plate was torn off by the impact with the wall. D1 stated that he had been driving straight in the center lane proceeding southbound at approximately 55 miles per hour when he began to change lanes into the right lane of traffic, nearest the outside shoulder. As he conducted the lane change, he did not notice the adjacent car off to the front right corner of his cab and merged, striking the left rear corner of V2 with the right front corner of his bumper. He stated that he was alerted to the other car by the sounds of screeching tires and became aware of the vehicle in front of him, spinning out of control and passing in front of, to the left of, and behind him before striking the inner wall. D2 corroborated this story, stating that he had felt the impact of the truck's bumper pushing his back end to the right. This caused his car to spin out, passing in front of the truck and into the passing (left) lane facing northbound while sliding backwards. He then continued to rotate counter-clockwise, skidding into the wall, with the back end of the vehicle striking the wall first. The car then sharply rotated another 180 degrees counterclockwise and impacted the wall again, coming to rest in that position.From investigation of damage pattern, debris field, physical damage to V2, as well as oral interviews with the drivers, it is likely that the following incident occurred: V1 was driving southbound in the center lane, while V2 was adjacent and just ahead of him in the right most lane. V1 attempted to change lanes into the right lane, striking the left rear quarter panel of V2 and causing him"

Vehicle 1 traveled into a slight curve to the right and started to lose control. The rear of Vehicle 1 started to rotate counter clock-wise. Vehicle 1 continued to rotate counter clock-wise until it was completely sideways with the passenger side doors facing northbound. At this point, Vehicle 1 left the roadway and struck the beginning of a guard rail with its front right fender. This impact caused the rear of Vehicle 1 to continue to rotate counter clock-wise until it was traveling backwards into the ditch. Vehicle 1 came to final rest a short time later in the ditch facing in a southwestern manner.Driver 1 stated that he noticed that the roadway was starting to get slick and reduced speed. Driver 1 said that even after dropping speed, he felt that the rear of his vehicle was unstable. Driver 1 indicated that at one point, he felt the rear of Vehicle 1 start to rotate counter clock-wise. Driver 1 stated that shortly after that he lost control of the vehicle.Observations-I observed tire tacks in the dirt/gravel that show the path of travel of Vehicle 1 into the guard rail and to final rest into the ditch. Approximately 15 feet of the guard rail was completely removed and curled up. Vehicle 1 had heavy damage to the passenger side of the vehicle. Vehicle 1's windows was shattered on the passenger side.

D1 did not wish to answer questions about how the accident happened. However, based upon statements from pursuing officers as well as surveillance camera footage obtained from Hoosier Express Car Wash, the following information was obtained about the accident. As D1 was actively leading Police Officers on a high speed pursuit (speeds said to be approximately 80mph), she approached the rear of V2. D2 saw in his rear view mirror that V1 was approaching at a high rate of speed. He therefore tried to turn right into the parking lot entrance of Hoosier Express Car Wash off of West 2nd Street. As V2 was turning right into this parking lot, V1 struck V2 in the left half side of the rear bumper. V2 then rotated clockwise before the front left tire hit a curbed median in the car wash parking lot entrance. This caused V2 to go airborne and flip one full rotation. V2 ultimately landed on the east side of this curbed median and came to a final rest facing in a northerly direction. After striking V2, V1 rotated approximately 180 degrees and then continued to travel east while facing west. V1 left the south side of the roadway just east of the car wash entrance.

U2 and U3 were laying in the roadway receiving medical attention. U3 had blood around her head. D1 said she was driving west on E 3rd Street and the sun was in her eyes so she could not see. Once D1 could see through the glare she saw U2 and U3 crossing, but it was too late to stop before colliding with them. Once D1 saw U2 and U3 she applied the brakes and swerved to the left, traveling over the curb and off the roadway. No skid marks were located on the roadway.U2 and U3 were receiving medical attention when I arrived on scene. They were both transported by ambulance to IU Health Bloomington Hospital. After clearing the scene, I went to IU Health Bloomington Hospital where I was able to speak with U2. U2 told me she was crossing the street with U3, who is blind and walks with a cane. U2 said she looked and saw V1 to the east, but thought there was plenty of time to cross. U2 said they reached the southern lane of travel when she was suddenly struck by V1 and recalls flipping over and landing on her side. U2 said her left hip and left knee hurt. There was also bruising on her left ankle. U2 said she was told by medical personnel that she hit her head on V1's windshield, but she did not remember that and did not have any head pain. I was unable to speak to U3 due to her need for medical attention and tests. Visitors of U3 told me she has a large bump and blood on her head, and said that she was experiencing back pain. W1 told me he was going west on E 3rd Street next to V1 and slightly behind it. W1 said he saw pedestrians in the roadway crossing, but D1 must not have. W1 estimated that V1 was traveling over the posted speed limit of 25 MPH. W1 estimated V1 was traveling between 30 and 35 MPH. W1 said the sun was likely in D1's eyes, and V1 did not slow down before the collision. W2 was outside on the balcony at 1200 E 3rd Street when he saw V1 approaching U2 and U3. W2 estimated that V1 was traveling between 30 and 35 MPH. W2 said V1 did not slow down prior to the collision, and he did not hear V1's tires make any noise consistent with braking hard. W2 said U2 was hit directly by the center of V1, and he heard U2's head hit V1's windshield. W1 said that U3 was struck by the passenger side corner of V1 and clipped by it. W3 was a passenger in V1 and sitting in the front passenger seat. W3 said he was looking down at his phone, but when he looked up he saw U2 and U3 in the road. W3 then yelled for D1 to stop, and D1 applied the brakes. D1 had consumed alcohol prior to the accident. Officer Haluda completed an OWI investigation. Blood draw results are pending. Charges may be filed pending the results of the blood draw. V1 sustained damage to the windshield, which was struck by U2's head. The windshield had pieces of U2's hair stuck in it. V1 was towed by Bland's due to the windshield's unsafe state. Photographs of the scene and V1 were taken. There were no skid marks present on the road.On 07/15/2019 Officer Haluda received the toxicology report for alcohol analysis and drug analysis from the Indiana Sate Department of Toxicology. The alcohol analysis result was 0.070 g/100 mL. The drug analysis result was positive for THC, measured at 1.7 ng/mL."

At the time of the crash it was overcast outside, but the roadway was dry. SR 446 is a very curvy road between Lawrence and Monroe County and is heavily traveled by motorcycles every year. Several motorcycle involved crashes occur on this highway every year. At the time of the crash traffic was low to moderate. Vehicle 1, a purple 2003 Yamaha YZF motorcycle, was traveling north on SR 446 near the Chapel Hill Rd. intersection. As V1 approached a right hand curve just north of the intersection, V1 lost control. V1 crossed the double yellow line in the center of the road then ran off the left (west) side of the roadway. V1 hit a traffic sign pole in the grass on the west side of the road before going down a short embankment and coming to a stop. Driver 1, Gavin Lutz, said he was traveling north on SR 446 just north of the Chapel Hill Rd. intersection. D1, told me that as he approached a right hand curve he hit a patch of gravel that was at the beginning of the curve near the center of the road. D1 said he continued straight forward while his bike wobbled. D1 advised me that he ran off the west side of the roadway and hit a traffic sign (curve advisory sign) with the rear wheel on his motor cycle. D1 told me that after that he believed he flipped over and fell off of his bike. Witness 1, Cameron Turpin, said he was traveling north on SR 446 in his truck directly behind V1. W1 said he watched as V1 entered into the right hand turn. W1 said it appeared as V1 was going too fast into the curve and lost control. W1 told me V1 never regained control and went off the roadway and struck a road side sign pole. After hitting the sign pole W1 said V1 spun down the embankment before coming to a stop on its side. Witness 2, Tyler Sheppard, advised that he as traveling north on SR 446 on his motorcycle directly behind V1. W2 said he watched as V1 enter into the right hand turn. W2 said it appeared as V1 was going too fast into the curve and lost control.Evidence shows the motorcycle was totaled due to damage all over the bike. Evidence shows D1 was transported to the hospital due to his injuries obtained during the crash. Evidence shows the roadway seemed clear. Evidence shows a broken down curve ahead sign. Evidence shows tire marks on the left side of roadway where the motorcycle left the roadway leading to where the sign use to stand."

Fire Department personnel determined that no one was inside the vehicle and that the engine was cold to the touch. While attempting to locate the registered owner to conduct a welfare check, the owner/driver of the vehicle contacted dispatch to report the collision. Driver 1 states that he was operating vehicle 1 northbound on North Old State Road 37 approaching the Sample Road intersection when a southbound vehicle came over the center divider line and nearly collided with his vehicle. Driver 1 states taht he swerved to avoid the collision which caused his vehicle to exit the northwest corner of the intersection into a ditch and row of trees before rolling onto its roof. Driver 1 states that he did not have any cellular phone service at the scene of the crash to contact emergency services and decided to walk to a nearby friends house at 8551 North Old SR 37 where he later contact Monroe County Dispatch to report the collision. Based on the vehicle's engine being cold to the touch when law enforcement and fire personnel arrived, it is believed that the collision occurred earlier in the morning on April 15 and driver 1 waited a considerable amount of time to report the collision to emergency services. Driver 1 smelled of alcohol during the investigation and provided a portable breath test sample of .050 BrAC. Based on the undetermined amount of time between the collision occurring and the investigation, no operating while intoxicated investigation was conducted.

Kinser Pike is a local road that runs in a northern and southern direction and intersects with SR45. The intersection of SR45 and Kinser Pike is a four-way intersection that uses traffic control signals for vehicular traffic flow. The traffic control signals were functioning properly at the time of the crash. V1 (2016 gray Ford Focus) was preparing to make a left turn from eastbound SR45 onto northbound Kinser Pike. V2 (2008 black Chevrolet Colorado pickup truck) was traveling westbound in the right lane of SR45. As V2 entered the intersection V1 failed to yield and attempted to make a left turn in front of V2. V2 then struck V1 in the passenger side rear door and fender area. This action caused V1 to rotate in a clockwise direction coming to final rest in the southbound lane of Kinser Pike facing west. V2 came to rest on the shoulder of SR45 westbound. D1 (Daniel Dundas) stated that he was traveling eastbound on SR45. He was attempting to make a left turn onto Kinser Pike northbound and did not see V2. D1 stated that he traveled in front of V2 and was struck on the passenger side by V2. He was wearing his seat belt.D2 (Jacob Cox) stated that he was traveling westbound in the right lane on SR45. D2 stated that V1 turned in front of him and he attempted to stop, but was unable to.

During the course of my investigation, I observed debris on the roadway in the intersection where the crash occurred. I, also observed disabling damage to V1 on the passenger side, rear door and fender. V2 also had disabling damage to the entire front end. D1 did not report any injuries. At the conclusion of my investigation, D2 stated that he had bruising on his lower left arm from the airbag.

SR45 is a 2-lane asphalt paved bi-directional highway that runs primarily northeast-southwest, and connects the city of Bloomington with Crane Naval Surface Activity. The area where the crash occurred is divided by a double-striped solid yellow line. The westbound lane is bounded by a large shoulder for vehicles to pass west-bound vehicles turning left onto Breeden road, which tees into SR45 and proceeds due south. The roadway on the evening of 22 April, 2019 was dry and clear of debris. The sky was overcast but clear, and there were no obvious signs of preexisting foreign objects or debris on the road surface. Traffic was light in the area at the time of the accident. Vehicle 1 (V1), was a black 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee (IN registration AZU468), driven by Driver 1 (D1), Steven Taylor (DOB 01/16/1977). Vehicle 2 (V2) was a 2012 Black Honda Pilot SUV (IN registration FAC372), driven by Driver 2 (D2), Janet McIntosh (DOB 04/23/2019). V1 came to an uncontrolled stop in a steep ditch on the right (north) side of SR45 approximately  mile to the west, (vicinity of 9995 SR 45) , while V2 came to a controlled stop on the right shoulder of SR45 E, just east the T-intersection of Breeden Rd. and SR 45 (vicinity 9534 SR45).The crash was initially witnessed by both Mr. Larry Conder, who lives at 9534 SR 45, and Trooper Mark Raper, who was off-duty at the time. I was dispatched to the scene and arrived after both vehicles had come to a stop off the roadway. Trooper Raper had already confirmed that both drivers were relatively stable. When I arrived at the scene, I shut down both lanes of traffic, which remained closed until both vehicles were cleared from the roadway. Bloomington Fire/Rescue was on scene to assist with medical needs. I made contact with both drivers to check on their wellbeing; both refused treatment. D1 had a visible bloody abrasion on his upper scalp in the crown of his hair but appeared otherwise uninjured. D2 had no visible injures and stated that she was fine, with only a slight friction burn on her fingers from the airbag deployment. D1, whose vehicle had come to rest in an uncontrolled manner in the ditch, spoke with firefighters before subsequently completing a Statement of Refusal (SOR) refusing treatment or examination. The airbags in V1 were not deployed, while the steering wheel airbag in V2 had deployed. V1 displayed severe damage to the front end and undercarriage of the vehicle and was missing both front wheels. The left front wheel was located approximately 150 yards to the west of V2 in the driveway of an adjacent home. The right front wheel was located in the ditch in front of V1. V2 had the grill smashed and hood buckled. Neither vehicle was drivable due to incapacitating damage. A linear scrape from the front left brake rotor of V1 contacting the roadway was clearly visible, beginning east of the site of the initial collision between V1's driver's side wheel and V2, and the ditch where V1 came to rest. D1 stated that he had been rounding the right hand curve on SR 45 westbound near the roundabout of West Sparks Road, when he heard a loud bang. He looked back into his side mirrors and observed a large object had come off his vehicle and made contact with a vehicle proceeding east. D1 stated; 'the next thing I knew, the whole front end drops on the ground and I'm in the ditch. I figured I was going to hit a tree.' D1 stated that he had been alone in the vehicle, which is titled to his father, and that he was heading home when the accident occurred. He stated that he tried to stop as fast as he could comprehend what had just happened, but due to his brakes failing, was unable to stop before he had effectually left the immediate scene of the accident and crashed into the ditch. He also advised that he and his son had just"

As we were approaching SR 45 the traffic control signal turned yellow for southbound and northbound traffic on Range Road/Pete Ellis Drive. I observed that D1 was already in the intersection attempting to make a left turn (westbound) onto SR 45 when D2 had just entered the intersection. As D1 started to make the turn, D2 collided with D1. It appeared to me that D2 had sufficient amount of time to brake in order to avoid the collision. I did not observed D2 apply the brakes until the collision occurred. It appeared that D2 may had been distracted while traveling southbound on Range Road crossing SR 45.D1 stated he was traveling northbound on Pete Ellis Drive approaching SR 45. D1 stated he entered the intersection as the traffic control signal had turned yellow and was turning left (westbound) onto SR 45 when D2 collided with him. D1 stated that D2 had her left turn signal activated (to turn eastbound on SR 45) which is why he began to turn. D1 stated that D2 continued straight instead of turning.

D2 stated he started to turn North bound onto Walnut Street heading towards McDonald's.D2 stated he heard the vehicle in front of him honk their horn and then noticed V1 in front of him but he did not have enough time to stop and struck V1 in the driver side. D2 stated he believes that D1 ran the red light and was in fact not turning from Walnut Street onto the Bypass. Their were no witnesses and I was unable to locate any cameras in the area that might have captured the accident. I also did not locate any debris in the intersection to determine the exact location of the accident and neither driver knew exactly where they collided. Due to most of the damage being on the passenger front of V2 and the damage being on the back driver side tire area of V1 it does appear that D2 used improper turning and collided with V1.SUPPLEMENTI had to change the year for V2 from a 2019 to a 2015.

The occupants of V2 are employed by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) and were completing inspections of the drainage structures along the median portion of the Bypass. An INDOT dump truck was parked along the median of the Bypass to the east of Monroe Street with an arrowboard attached to its rear to warn traffic traveling west on the Bypass. The dump truck was occupied by Chad Lamastus, DOB 9-3-1974. V1 began to make a left turn to travel west on the Bypass.

V1 continued to spin after impact with V1 until it was facing north in the eastbound left turn lane of the Bypass. V1 then traveled west along the Bypass and D1 failed to stop after impact. Both occupants of V2 indicated their attention was focused on inspecting the center drainage structure when they felt an impact by V1.

Evidence shows a portion of broken amber plastic lens was present along the roadway during the accident investigation. The photograph provided by W1 was a brown Jeep Liberty with Indiana registration ANY132. A records check indicated the vehicle was registered to Christopher Miller, 4500 S. Dunlap Road, Bloomington, IN. I traveled to 4500 S. Dunlap Road but there was no vehicles present at the residence. I determined via social media search that Christopher Miller was currently engaged to Nataley Kinser. Kinser is a white female with dark colored hair. I was unable to locate Kinser or Miller after checking the above address numerous times throughout the day. On Monday, April 29, 2019 at approximately 7:45 pm, I traveled to 4500 S. Dunlap Road and observed the brown Jeep Liberty with Indiana registration ANY132. A white male was present outside the residence who identified himself verbally as Christopher Miller.

I69 is a divided 6-lane north-south highway, which connects Evansville and Indianapolis by way of Bloomington. The center median is paved with a permanent concrete barrier topped by reflectors, whih separates the north and south lanes of traffic. Both shoulders are paved and approximately one car-width, with the left bounded by the center concrete divider wall and the right lane bounded by a metal guard rail. The shoulder on both sides of the driving lanes are delineated with a white reflective painted fog line. The lanes of travel are divided by a broken white lines in this area. Fullerton Pike, a 2-way paved city road, passes over I69 by way of an overpass approximately 500 feet to the south of where the collision occurred. The roadway on the afternoon of Friday, April 26, 2018 was cloudy but clear, with the road surface dry. There were no signs of preexisting fluids or foreign substances on the roadway. Vehicle 1 (V1), was a 2006 blue-grey Chevrolet Cobalt 4-door passenger car, (TN registration BZL642). Vehicle 2 (V2) was a white Peterbilt 2012 semi tractor (IN registration 2036940), pulling a 2012 aluminum HEI bulk carrier trailer (IN registration P720388). V2 had come to a controlled stop on the shoulder just past the end of the merge lane of the exit ramp from Fullerton Pike onto I69, on the right shoulder. V1 had also come to a controlled stop behind V2 on the right shoulder.I was travelling northbound when I observed both vehicles pulled over on the right shoulder just past the end of the exit ramp leading from Fullerton Pike onto northbound I69. I activated my emergency lights and made contact with both drivers, ensuring that neither of them were injured. Both drivers were outside the vehicles when I arrived on scene. Vehicle 1 (V1) had heavy damage to the exterior of the driver's side door, the exterior metal of which was torn. Additionally the rear left tire was flattened. There were various marks and abrasions to the left side of the vehicle. Vehicle 2 (V2) had light damage to the slotted aluminum running board on the exterior of the right (passenger) side exterior fuel tank. Driver 1 (D1)(Rivera) stated that she lived in Tennessee until recently and had just moved back to Indiana. She stated that she was merging onto I69 from Fullerton Pike and simply didn't see the truck as she changed lanes from the ramp into the right-most of the 3 northbound lanes. She stated that she 'simply merged right into the right into him', coming into contact with the tractor cab. She then immediately swerved away from the contact after becoming aware of the truck to her left. Driver 2 (D2)(Collings) stated that he was driving straight in the right-most lane of travel when he observed the vehicle coming down the ramp overtaking him from the rear. He was unable to merge into the lanes to his left to make space for the incoming vehicle, which continued to merge until it ran out of lane and came into contact with the right side of his vehicle. He had continued to drive straight within his lane of travel until the crash, at which time he braked and came to rest on the right side of the road on the shoulder. Based upon my investigation of the scene, the physical damage to both vehicles, and the interviews of both drivers, it is likely that the following occurred: V1 merged into the side of V2, which was unable to change lanes due to its large size and the heavy traffic. As such, D1 is at fault for failure to yield the right of way to vehicles in the northbound lanes of travel, resulting in V1 colliding into and sideswiping V2."

After getting information regarding the suspect vehicle, I put that information out over the radio to officers and deputies and had dispatch provide that information to Ellettsville Police. When I arrived, I met with the complainant Darrell Poer, the driver of a black BMW Z3 convertible, (IN PE plate, IUKXAZ) and witness Dominic Dpoffo. Poer advised that he had been driving westbound on the East State Road 45/46 Bypass near East 17th Street around 1259. Poer advised that there was a red Dodge Ram pickup truck in the right lane that was going slower than he was, so Poer moved from the right lane into the left lane to attempt to pass the truck. As Poer pulled into the left lane, the truck accelerated sharply, preventing him from being able to pass, so Poer got back into the right lane behind the truck. As they continued on the Bypass between 17th Street and North Fee Lane, the truck slowed down as it approached a car ahead of it. Poer again moved into the left lane to try to pass the Dodge. As he began to pull alongside the truck, the driver of the truck jerked the steering wheel sharply to the left, into the passing lane that Poer was in. Poer advised that he also had to jerk his wheel to the left to avoid a collision with the truck, and as a result, his driver side wheels and tires struck the raised curb median. Poer pointed out damage to both front and rear driver side rims and the front driver side tire from the impact with the curb. Poer said he went to pull over after striking the curb, but the truck continued on without stopping, so Poer continued on, following the Dodge, catching up with the Dodge at the traffic light at North Dunn Street. Poer then pulled around the truck west of the intersection and stopped ahead of it, exiting his vehicle to speak with the driver. Poer described the truck's driver as a husky white male in his late fifties or early sixties with sandy brown hair, a mustache and beard and wearing a long-sleeved high-visibility construction type shirt. As Poer approached the truck, he said he asked the driver ""What are you doing? You ran me off of the road intentionally!"". Poer said the male answered, ""I've got the right of way! I've got the right of way!"", remaining in the truck and then drove around Poer's vehicle and left, heading westbound on East State Road 46 toward Ellettsville. Dpoffo advised that he witnessed the entire sequence of events, from the intersection of East 17th Street to the point where Poer spoke with the truck driver while driving west on the Bypass in his own vehicle. Dpoffo said that when Poer initially tried to pass the red truck, the driver ""gunned it"" so aggressively that Dpoffo, who was following behind in his own vehicle, backed off from 5 or 6 car lengths behind in the left lane, to 10 or 11 car lengths behind. When I asked Dpoffo more regarding that, he said that he thought this was going to turn into a more serious incident based on the behavior of the truck driver so he backed off for safety reasons. When Poer attempted to pass the Dodge truck a second time, Dpoffo said he witnessed the truck jerk sharply into the passing lane so that the truck veered halfway into that left lane. This action caused Poer to have to also jerk left to avoid the truck and the BMW's driver side wheels struck the curb. Dpoffo also witnessed when Poer exited his vehicle and spoke with the truck driver. Dpoffo characterized Poer's tone and approach as ""non-aggressive"" and just wanting to ask why that had happened. Dpoffo said he noted the truck's license plate and he was the one who had provided it to after the truck driver left the scene. While no officers located the truck, the license plate Dpoffo provided, IN CL plate AA581, returned to a 2014"

When he looked back forward he was unable to stop in time and he collided with V3.On the SR 45/46 Bypass, vehicles were traveling west in the right hand lane near the Genesis Church entrance off of the Bypass. V5 and V4 had slowed to a complete stop for stopped traffic ahead of them. D3 observed V5, V4, and other traffic come to a stop ahead of her. D3 slowed to a crawl about to stop completely when V1 did not see traffic stop and collided with the rear end of V3. The force of the collision then sent V3 forward colliding with V4. The force from V3 colliding with V4 sent the front part of V4 into the rear end of V5. V2 was traveling west bound behind V1 and observed V1 attempt to stop suddenly behind V3. V2 attempted to stop in time to avoid colliding with V1, but was unable to stop in time and collided into the rear portion of V1 with the front end of V2.While D1 was traveling west bound in V1 behind V3, he stated that he was looking at his side mirrors to see if he could move to the left lane. While D1 was looking at his mirrors, he did not recognize that traffic was stopping ahead of him. D1 then slammed on the brakes in an attempt to avoid a collision with V3. D1 stated that he was traveling at around 40mph. Due to his speed and being distracted by looking at his mirrors, he did not have enough time to stop for the stopped traffic ahead of him, which resulted in the collision with V3 and the collisions involving V2, V3, V4, and V5. D2 stated that she was driving behind V1 and noticed V1 stop suddenly. V2 was traveling at around 40mph and the sudden stopping of V1 did not allow her enough time to stop, which resulted in V2 striking the rear end of V1. V5 was stopped in traffic in front of V4 when the collision happened. There was no damage sustained to the vehicle from V4 so D5 has been left out of this report. D5 stated that she did not need to be in the report due to sustaining no damage or injuries. D5 stated she would contact IUPD if she notices any damage due to the collision at a later time."

V2 was originally traveling in the right lane but changed lanes to the left lane as a construction vehicle was slowly traveling partially in the right hand lane and partially the side of the road about 150 feet ahead of V2.

After she switched to the left lane she began to slow her vehicle for slowing traffic ahead of her. D2 stated she then saw V1 pull out in front of her which led to the collision.Both drivers did not complain of pain and did not request an ambulance at any point of the accident investigation. Later after both parties had arrived at their destinations after the accident, D2 contacted IUPD requesting an ambulance to check her out as she began to feel pain from the accident. Bloomington Hospital Ambulance Service unit 2164 responded to D2's residence to evaluate her. I responded to the residence as well. D2 complained of pain to her chest from the seatbelt and pain to her left arm from the airbag deployment. D2's left arm was visibly red and appeared to be starting to swell. D2 denied the offer to be transported to the hospital for further evaluation and stated she would go to the doctor if the pain worsened. It is to be noted that there is no traffic signal at the intersection of the SR 45/46 Bypass and N. Range Rd. Traffic turning onto N.

I received information from the Monroe Reservoir property management stating that their security personnel located a motorcycle, license plate M372VC, crashed in a ditch in front of the Fairfax Inn. I walked from the boat rental dock, across the parking lot to find a purple/silver 1999 Yamaha motorcycle, license plate M372VC, facing west toward the road from the parking lot, in the ditch on its side. I observed tracks in the grass coming from the parking lot. The operator, later identified as Thomas Goodman, operated the motorcycle from the parking lot, over the embankment, down the hill, and wrecked into the ditch along the main road, causing property damage. When I arrived on scene Thomas Goodman was not around his motorcycle that was in the ditch.I photographed the motorcycle as it was when I arrived. The windshield was broken off the motorcycle and approximately two (2) to three (3) feet in front of it. Indiana Department of Natural Resources-Parks and Reservoirs Division (IDNR), has security guards that are civilians but respond to complaints and calls such as this one. The IDNR security guard had driven by the site of the accident approximately forty five (45) minutes prior to observing the motorcycle in the ditch, so the accident occurred between 2017 hours and 1932 hours.While looking over the motorcycle for any evidence, I observed blood on it and I photographed that area. I also located a few cubes of ice on the ground within one (1) foot of the motorcycle which lead me to believe the accident occurred recent being it was over eighty (80) degrees outside that day. The IDNR security guard drove up and down Fair Fax Road, in an attempt to locate a subject that appeared to have been involved in a motorcycle accident but was unable to locate anyone. IDNR Property Manager Cory Rieman also came to the scene, from his house which is right inside the gate house of Monroe Reservoir property and did not see anyone walking along the road that appeared to be in a motorcycle accident. IDNR Property Manager Cory Rieman spoke with the front desk of the Fair Fax Inn and they did not speak with Thomas Goodman as of approximately 2030 hours. IDNR Property Manager Cory Rieman also spoke with the front gate who had also not seen nor heard from Thomas Goodman. ICO Corporal Brian Bailey, who was off duty checked the bar area for Thomas Goodman and did not locate him. I spoke with the Fair Fax bar outside the gate house, which they did not serve Thomas Goodman, nor was he inside their place when I spoke with them. Monroe County Sheriff Department (MCSD) Deputies went to the address, 2525 Bryan Street in Bloomington, the address on the Bureau of Motor Vehicle Return (BMV) return from the license plate. MCSD Deputies were unable to make contact with anyone at that residence. I had Kens West Side Towing come and tow the motorcycle to their storage facility. Sunday, May 26, 2019I received a call from MCSD Deputy Miller who advised me that Thomas Goodman had called in and reported his motorcycle stolen. MCSD Deputy Miller advised me of Thomas Goodman's phone number, 812-322-8265.Saturday, June 8, 2019After several phone calls not getting answered over the previous weeks, ICO Corporal Brian Bailey went to 2525 Bryan Street in Bloomington, at 0818 hours and spoke with Thomas Goodman's parents who advised he lives at 900 N Curry Pike Trailer 26 Bloomington, IN, 47404. ICO Corporal Brian Bailey was unable to make contact with Thomas Goodman at that address. He could not get anyone at that residence to answer the door, but he did leave a card advising Thomas Goodman that I needed to speak with him. At approximately 1445 hours, Thomas Goodman called into ICO Dispatch.At 1452 hours, I was able to reach Thomas"

Vehicle # 1 ran off the south side of the highway and struck the end of a guard rail, bending part of the guard rail forcing it to block the right lane. The vehicle continued over the guard rail and guard rail posts eventually striking a flashing signal and post, along with the 107 mile marker post. The vehicle flipped/rolled and came to rest on the passenger's side on top of the guard rail facing north. During the course of the events, the tank dislodged from vehicle # 1and came to rest in a ditch. Both lanes of the northbound interstate were periodically closed with periodic right lane closure. On Saturday June 1, 2019, I spoke to witness # 1 and learned she was northbound on the interstate following vehicle # 1 in the left lane. Witness # 1 was preparing to pass vehicle # 1 that was in the right lane. Witness # 1 said vehicle # 1 did not appear to be speeding. Witness # 1 said the vehicle crossed the fog line and struck the guard rail. On Sunday June 2, 2019, I attempted to interview driver # 1. This crash remains incomplete pending my interview with driver # 1. On the evening on Wednesday June 5, 2019, I spoke to driver # 1 and learned he dozed off prior to running off the roadway.

At the time of the crash it was day light outside and traffic was medium to heavy. Bunger Rd. is a two lane two way road that runs north and south. At the intersection where the crash took place there is a slight high just east of the intersection. Vehicle 1, a gold 1998 Chevy truck pulling a black 2000 open ended trailer, was traveling west on SR 45 near the Bunger Rd. intersection. Vehicle 2, a white 2016 Chevy van, was traveling east on SR 45 nearing the Bunger Rd. intersection. V1 lost control and swerved into the oncoming east bound traffic lane. V2 was side swiped by V1's trailer. V2 pulled over shortly into a close by drive way on the south side of the road way. V1 continued swerving out of control west bound on SR 45. V1's trailer finally broke loose from V1. V1 was pushed off the north side of the roadway into a tree. After hitting the tree the vehicle swung around in the ditch before getting logged into another tree. V1 came to rest in a ditch against a tree facing east. The trailer that had been attached to the V1 continued west on SR 45 before coming to stop in the roadway approximately 50 feet west of V1. Driver 1, Paul Frye, told me he was driving west on SR 45 near the Bunger Rd. intersection. D1 said all of a sudden he could feel the trailer he was pulling start to pull him from side to side. D1 told me he tried to gain control of his truck by over steering but was unsuccessful. D1 stated that he was not sure what happened because, it happened so quickly, but that he spun out of control before running of the road and crashing into a tree. Driver 2, Kayleena Myers, said she was traveling east on SR 45 near the Bunger Rd. intersection. D2 said she watched as V1 was traveling west on SR 45 swerving from side to side. D2 said that it appeared as if D1 would gain control of his vehicle before passing her. D2 said she slowed down almost to a stop when she realized that V1 was not gaining control and still coming at her in the east bound lane. D2 she watched as V1 missed her van but side swiped her vehicle with the trailer D1 was pulling. Evidence shows heavy damage to V1. Evidence shows a light scuff mark along the driver side of V2. Evidence shows swerving tire marks along the west bound lane of SR 45 just west of the Bunger Rd. intersection. Evidence shows the hitch where V1 would have been attached to the trailer was malfunctioning and the chains broken off. **It is this Troopers belief that the hitch on the trailer was broken prior to the crash, causing the trailer to break loose and cause the crash. ** Driver 1 signed paperwork with the on scene EMS crew stating he was denying medical transport or treatment but stated he was going to go to hospital with wife (who showed up on scene later) with complaints of neck/head pain. D1 appeared to sustained an abrasion on back of his head."

I noticed a black SUV turn left onto eastbound 3rd Street from State Road 46. As the vehicle made the turn, it ""fish tailed"" and began to drive toward my vehicle. Just before colliding into my patrol car, the vehicle hit the median on 3rd Street and changed direction to go south across 3rd Street. The vehicle then collided with a concrete post in the grass on the south side of 3rd Street. The vehicle did not stop, it regained direction and fled eastbound on 3rd Street.I initiated my emergency lights, then crossed the raised median of 3rd Street and went eastbound on 3rd in emergency mode attempting to catch up to the vehicle. As I approached the Smith Road intersection, I saw a black SUV in the distance turn north from 3rd Street into a business parking lot. I attempted to find the vehicle in two parking lots on the north side of 3rd Street, but was unable to locate the vehicle. The black SUV that I saw turn into a lot was not the vehicle in question. I determined that I was unable to locate the vehicle and went to the Burger King located at 3rd and College Mall Road. I met with Officer Cooksey who was in the office of Burger King looking at video footage. Video footage captured the vehicle crossing 3rd Street and colliding with the concrete post. The license plate of the vehicle was unreadable. The vehicle appeared to be an older model black GMC Jimmy or perhaps a Yukon. Officer Cooksey and I were unable to determine exactly what model of SUV the vehicle was.The concrete post was a short concrete post that is believed to be part of the Old National Bank that was formerly located at that location. It is believed that the post belongs to Burger King. There is no further information regarding this case. The vehicle, its owner and occupants are unknown at this time. This case is inactive."

Driver #1 indicated she reached for a napkin to grab the spider and put it out her window when she heard and felt a loud bang and the next thing she knew it felt like she was off the roadway and then came to a stop. Driver #1 indicated all she was trying to do was get rid of the spider and didn't realize she had drifted off the roadway. Witness #1 (Jeff Vandiver) indicated he was in the far right lane about 200 yards behind Vehicle #1. Witness #1 indicated it was raining hard (pouring) and all he saw was Vehicle #1 drift to the right and get tied up with the electronic road sign and then down the ditch to the fence.Witness #2 (Tousif Ahmed) indicated he was in the middle lane about a car length behind Vehicle #1 and they were running about the same speed. Witness #2 indicated Vehicle #1 suddenly moved to the shoulder of the interstate and struck the large digital sign and then went down the ditch. Driver #1 indicated she was distracted by a spider in the passenger compartment of Vehicle #1 which caused her to crash. There is no evidence to prove either way as to what caused the accident. With the lack of markings on the roadway and the statements of both witnesses Driver #1 must have been distracted inside Vehicle #1 to cause Vehicle #1 to drift onto the shoulder causing this accident. Driver #1 was checked by EMS personnel and she signed a release form refusing medical treatment or transportation to hospital. Drive #1 reported she was wearing her seatbelt and there was airbag deployment. The sign board was a Signalisation Board (Ver-Mac INC.) with a VIN: 1V9US4128JH223165.N 39 10.601W 086 33.721"

I got the complainant's driver and vehicle information as well as took pictures and advised her that I would email her the info as soon as I could. I arrived at 4513 Carmola drive and observed a white male who identified himself as Austin Stephens sitting in the driver's seat. Deputy Williams had already conducted a license check, and it showed that Stephens's driving privileges were showing suspended infraction. According to a witness who was identified as David Reid Wilson II, advised that he was sitting a couple of cars back on Union Valley Drive when he observed the accident. Wilson told me that the vehicle that was at fault then ran the red light and headed eastbound on S.R. 46 W and then turned on to Smith Pike and then turned on to Carmola but could not find the vehicle when he was able to turn on to Carmola.A second witness identified herself as Abagail Boatright told me that she was behind the vehicle, and it caught her eye because she believed that the driver sped up as he went over the hill and down toward the intersection where Duncan was sitting. Boatright stated that she observed the collision and then noticed the suspect's car back up and appear to flee the area trying to get away.After I arrived, I advised Stephens that I would be issuing him three citations. The first one is for leaving the scene of an accident, the second one is for Driving while suspended, and the third is for disregarding the automatic signal at the intersection of Union Valley Road and Indiana State Highway 46 West.No diagram vehicles moved prior to officers arrival"

D1 stated that he went to brake and his foot did not get a full placement on the brake pedal, but instead the bottom of his foot pressed down on the side of the brake pedal, giving him the inability to come to a stop before hitting V2.D2 stated that she was driving south on Curry Pike in the left lane when the vehicles in front of her started braking. D2 stated that she began braking and noticed V1 was approaching her from behind. D2 stated that she turned her wheel to the left and pulled up a little further to give V1 more room to stop. D2 stated that V1 was unable to stop in time and rear ended her, causing her to rear end V3.D3 stated that she was stopped in traffic facing south in the left lane on Curry Pike when she was suddenly rear ended by V2.It should be noted that the passenger in V2 did have a complaint of back pain, but his father denied immediate medical attention.

Both parties were separated as I gathered their accounts of what happened.V1 was parked in valid parking stall that was perpendicular to Law Lane and was attempting to back out onto Law Lane.V2 was traveling westbound on Law Lane and approaching the Jordan Avenue intersection. V2 then began to come to a stop behind an unrelated vehicle that was completely stopped at the red light. This placed V2 directly behind and perpendicular to V1.D2 stated that he was traveling westbound on Law Lane and approaching a stopped vehicle at the Jordan Avenue intersection at a low rate of speed. At that time, V1 backed from their parking stall and collided with the front, passenger portion of his vehicle. The damage was at the front of the door where it meets with the front quarter panel and bends inward. The damage caused the front passenger door to no longer open correctly as it now made physical contact with the quarter panel. Both occupants, O1 and O2, both agreed with D2's side of the story and gave the same accounts.D1 stated that she was backing her SUV out of the parking stall and began to hear the beeping from her reverse sensors. She then stated that she made slight contact with V2. She stated that the contact would have been on the rear, passenger part of the vehicle and not the front, passenger portion of the vehicle as D2 alleged. D1 was adamant she did not cause the damage to V2 and claimed the damage to V2 was likely from a prior incident.*The height of V1's rear bumper was consistent with the damage location to V2. The damage to V2 did appear new as the front passenger was unable to exit the vehicle correctly without causing further damage to the door and quarter panel.There are no other witnesses or cameras in the area. Both vehicles were able to be driven safely from the scene and none of individuals involved complained of injury."

Both vehicles had moved into the parking lot of the Sprint Store (2500 E 3rd St) before I arrived.D1 stated she was headed eastbound when she suddenly saw V2's emergency lights. I asked her when she first saw the emergency lights and she pointed to the Christian Science Church (second building west of the intersection, on the north side of the street) and said she was driving past it. I asked her where the collision took place and she estimated it was in front of the first house west of the intersection, and claimed it was definitely before she actually reached the intersection itself. She said she was not from this area and was looking for a safe place to pull over, when she observed the traffic signal at 3rd & Woodscrest start to change. She said she did not want to run the light, so she braked and was then impacted in the rear by V2. I asked D1 and her passenger if they were injured and they both said ""no."" V1 had a few existing scrapes and dings on its rear bumper, but D1 pointed out what appeared to be a small, fresh dent in the center. It appeared to be damage caused by the front license plate bracket on V2.D2 stated he was attempting to initiate a traffic stop for several erratic driving violations but that D1 did not react to his police car's emergency lighting equipment. Suddenly, in the middle of the intersection at 3rd & Woodscrest, he said V1 came to an abrupt stop in the intersection. D2 said he then attempted to brake but started skidding and could not come to a full stop before colliding with the rear of V1. There was no visible damage on V2.Dash-mounted camera footage of the crash shows V2's emergency lights had been activated for approximately eleven seconds prior to the collision. D1 does not yield to the emergency lights and does not yield for the first ten seconds, continuing to drive in the left lane despite there being no traffic at all that would prevent her from moving right as required by law. V1 is shown to come to a very abrupt stop, past the stop line and crosswalk, in the middle of the intersection while the traffic signal was yellow.

Traffic was intermittenly heavy on this day.Vehicle #1, a 2016 silver Dodge caravan, was east bound on SR 46 when it ran off the south side of the road crashing head-on into a tree. V1 sustained heavy and disabling damage to its entire front and middle portions.Driver #1, Oliver Williams III, was interviewed at the Bloomington Hospital due to the nature of his injuries. D1 stated he was traveling east on SR 46. D1 was escorting his passenger to Brown County from Terre Haute. D1 stated he just stopped at a gas station to stretch their legs and were back enroute to Brown County when he thinks he jerked the wheel to the right because he may have been too far left of center. Next thing D1 knew they were running off the road and into grass before he tried applying the brakes. D1 was unable to stop V1 from colliding into the tree. D1 sustained a large cut to his right wrist, cuts to the face from the glass from the windshield, and a possible broken left knee. It's highly likely these injuries could have been mitigated using the seat belt. Passenger #1, Alexzander Sizemore, was also interviewed at the Bloomington hospital due to his injuries. P1 stated he was reading and had his head rested on the headrest when he felt V1 jerk. The jolt caused him to look up and the next thing he knew D1 was off the road and trying to apply the brakes in the grass but V1 did not stop. P1 braced for impact. P1 sustained cuts to his hands and head.Witness #1, Isaiah Winter, was driving east in a red mini-van on SR 46 located directly behind V1. W1 saw V1 drift left of center and then jerk or over correct and then run off the road. W1 did not see brake lights until V1 was already in the grass and then strike a tree."

Shortly thereafter, they requested an officer respond to the scene to take a report. When I arrived on scene, I met with Kristy Curtis, the owner of a black Honda CR-V, bearing IN CM plate UCY815. Curtis advised that the driver of the other vehicle, later identified as Tsehainesh Teklezghi, backed a black Nissan Rogue (IN PC 658UP) into Curtis's parked Honda, while trying to leave. I spoke with Teklezghi, who stated that she had decided to move the Nissan from the Forest Circle Drive and accidentally backed it (backing southeast) into the parked Honda, which was facing west. Teklezghi said that there was no damage to her vehicle's rear bumper. There were a few scrapes to the front bumper of Honda CR-V toward the driver side from the impact. When I had dispatch run Teklezghi's information, they advised that her license was suspended, with a prior conviction. When I ran Teklezghi's information on my MDD, I was able to view a driver's license photo which matched her and see that she had several recent violations on her license history and a history of failures to appear. Teklezghi was also unable to provide proof of insurance for the vehicle that she was driving, advising that the Nissan belonged to her son's father. I called for a tow truck and arrested Teklezghi for Driving While Suspended, Prior, a class A misdemeanor. Officer Schmitt performed an inventory of the vehicle and Sergeant Snyder handled the tow through Auto Mobile. The Nissan will be held for proof of insurance and valid driver. I handcuffed Teklezghi and searched her incident to arrest. I double-locked the cuffs and checked them for tightness, readjusting them and double-locking again when she complained of pain, stating that she had prior problems with her left wrist. I placed her in the rear of unit 224 and transported her to Monroe County Jail, where I booked her in on a charge of Driving While Suspended, Prior. I request that a copy of this case be forwarded to the Monroe County Prosecutor's Office for review. Copies of the remand sheet and tow/inventory forms are attached to this case.*****************************************SUPPLEMENT**************************************************************On 08/22/2019, Gezaie Ghirmay, the owner of the black Nissan Rogue, came to retrieve his vehicle. Ghirmay has a valid driver's license and showed proof that his vehicle was insured at the time of the crash. I have added that information to this case and contacted the insurance agent of Ms. Curtis to inform them of this information."

S/Trp Mark Raper PE 6473 had arrived prior to my arrival and checked the truck and determined that it did not meet the criteria for a commercial motor vehicle and did not require an inspection.Vehicle 1, white Dodge Charger, Indiana State Police commission #3581 mileage 60752 was being operated by Trp. Richard Klun PE 8503 and was going straight south on Gates Drive South of Jacob Drive. This unit administered a PBT to Trp. Klun with a result of 0.00.Vehicle 2, yellow International 430 Box Truck, was being operated by Michael Abbitt southbound on Gates Drive next to Vehicle 1. Vehicle 2 turned on his left turn signal and then proceeded to move into the right lane with the passenger side middle of the truck striking the front left of Vehicle 1.Driver 2, Abbitt, stated that he was going south on Gates Drive and that he turned on his turn signal and did not see Vehicle 1 veer around him. Driver 2 said that his passenger side struck Vehicle 1. When asked about wearing a seat belt, Driver 2 stated that he did not have a seat belt of any kind on at the time of this crash. When asked a second time if no lap nor shoulder belt was in use at the time of this crash, Driver 2 again said that he was not wearing any kind of restraint.Driver 1, Klun, stated that he had been behind Vehicle 2 and that Driver 1 turned on his turn signal then moved into the right lane on Gates Drive. As Vehicle 1 came beside Vehicle 2, Vehicle 2 came over into Vehicle 1's lane and the right middle of Vehicle 2 struck the left front of Vehicle 1.Vehicle 1 is equipped with an in-car camera system that captured this crash on video. In the video Vehicle 1 is in the right lane and coming up beside Vehicle 2 in the left lane. Vehicle 2 comes over into the right lane and strikes Vehicle 1. As the crash progresses it is seen on the video that Vehicle 2 had turned his left turn signal on, however Vehicle 2 moved into the right lane causing this crash.The cause of this crash is Vehicle 2's unsafe lane movement."

Samuel Wagner, was dispatched to a crash on State Road 48 at the intersection of S Hickory Dr., Bloomington, Monroe County, Indiana. I arrived to the location of the crash at approximately 16:05. Both vehicles were pulled off the road into the parking lot of the Old National Bank located at 4191 West 3rd Street. At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the road surface was dry. State Road 48, in the area where the crash occurred, is a primarily east-west 4 lane divided highway, with center turn lane. Approximately 830 feet to the east is a major intersection where SR 48 intersects with Curry PIke, a local 4 lane undivided highway that runs primarily north-south. Both drivers were wholly uninjured and refused medical treatment. Vehicle 1 (V1), a white Nissan passenger car, had sustained substantial damage to the front end, with the grill smashed and pushed into the radiator, the hood buckled, and damage to the headlights and bumper. Vehicle 2 (V2), a maroon Ford SUV, had sustained damage to the rear bumper and showed white paint transfer marks. Both vehicles were drivable and did not require towing. There were no readily apparent skid marks or debris on the roadway. The traffic at this time of day was heavy in all directions. When interviewing both drivers, their statements about what had occurred were both virtually identical, and are given as follows: V1, a white Nissan passenger car, bearing Indiana registration TMO220, and driven by Driver 1 (D1), Maureen Langley, was going east in the left of two eastbound lanes, when it encountered a large amount of slowed and stopped traffic approaching the intersection of SR 48 and Curry Pike. V2, a maroon Ford Escape, bearing Indiana temporary plates K598115, was driven by D2, Mabel Smith, and had recently come to a complete stop in the left lane prior to the collision. V1 began slowing behind V2, which was stopped due to the heavy traffic waiting at the intersection to the east. However, as the traffic moved forward slightly, D2 briefly released the brakes, causing the brake lights to cease being illuminated. D1, who stated that she was distracted at that moment, said that she only 'registered that D2's brake lights were not illuminated', so she assumed she was still moving forward and was not stopped, and accelerated forward, colliding with the rear end of V2, which had begun applying the brakes again, coming to a full stop. Driver 2 agreed that she had simply released the brakes to move forward slightly before reapplying them when she felt a collision from the rear. Both drivers had then moved their vehicles out of the roadway to the parking lot adjacent to the intersection of SR 48 and Hickory Drive. There were no witnesses that remained to make a statement regarding the collision. Based upon my investigation, the evidence at the scene, and the statements of both drivers, which agreed with one another, it likely that the following occurred; due to distraction and following too closely, V1 failed to yield to slowing and stopped traffic, colliding with the rear of V2, which had only briefly released the brakes and was at or nearly at a complete stop in heavy traffic, waiting for a red light to change. As such, D1 is primarily at fault for the collision."

D2 stated that he had stopped in traffic at the intersection of East 10th Street with North Union to allow the car ahead of him to turn. While D2 was stopped in traffic, V2 was rear-ended by V1. There was no damage to V1 from the collision. V2 had scuffs and marks on the rear center and passenger side rear bumper. After the crash, both drivers pulled into the parking lot of Village Pantry where they contact IUPD. I spoke with both drivers and inspected their vehicles at that location. D2 complained of pain in his neck. IU Health Bloomington Hospital paramedics examined D2 at the scene. He was not transported and signed a release form. D1 advised that he had just purchased V1 the previous evening and had not yet registered the vehicle or purchased insurance. After speaking with D1, he obtained auto insurance through Progressive while at the scene and agreed to leave the vehicle parked and avoid driving the vehicle until he a temporary plate or had his current license plate transferred to the vehicle. As of the time of the crash, V1 did not have valid insurance. I issued D1 a citation for Operating without Proof of Financial Responsibility, 9-25-8-2."

Vehicle 2 was traveling east on 3rd Street approaching the intersection of Dunn Street in the right lane.Driver 1 left the scene of the accident.Driver 2 stated that he was traveling in the right lane when Vehicle 2 quickly swerved into his lane with no warning, or turn signal, and struck the driver's side front bumper of his vehicle causing him to leave to roadway and drive onto the sidewalk. Driver 2 advised that Vehicle 1 immediately reentered the left lane and drove away. He stated that he then reentered the right lane and began following the vehicle. Driver 2 stated Vehicle 1 then moved into the right lane and continued driving. Driver 2 advised he was able to obtain a photograph of the plate on the vehicle and could see the driver of the vehicle before pulling over to contact police. He stated he was able to describe the male.Driver 2 advised that the driver was a white male with short white hair. After describing the male I asked Driver 2 if he would be able to identify the driver with a photograph. He stated he could and I showed him the BMV photograph for the male registered owner of Vehicle 1. Driver 2 advised that this was the male that struck him. I asked Driver 2 if it was possible that Driver 1 could have not noticed that he was involved in an accident. Driver 2 stated that the collision sounded extremely loud and had enough force to cause his vehicle to go off the roadway. Driver 2 also stated that when he began following the vehicle he noticed Driver 1 stared straight forward and, in Driver 2's opinion, avoided making any eye contact with him in the mirrors of the vehicle.No one involved complained of any injuries.I was able to obtain Driver 1's home address in Bedford, Indiana through the Indiana BMV. Lawrence County Sheriff's Department assisted me in going to Driver 1's address to speak with him. When Driver 1 answered the door with his wife he smelled strongly of the odor of alcoholic beverage and his eyes were bloodshot. I began explaining why I was there and Driver 1 immediately began denying driving the vehicle. His wife claimed she was driving her vehicle in Bloomington, Indiana today. When I asked where she was driving her vehicle she immediately stated ""3rd Street."" His wife then began stating repeatedly that she had no idea that she struck someone. She stated that she had located the damage but was unsure of when it had occurred and was going to contact the insurance company in the morning. I asked Driver 1 how much he had to drink and he immediately stated that he had not started drinking until he got home. I explained to Driver 1 that the subject in the vehicle he struck identified him and he continued denying the accident. I then explained to Driver 1 that I was issuing him a misdemeanor citation for Leaving the Scene of an Accident. Driver 1 stated that the damage on the vehicle was just a scuff from rubber and denied much of the damage. Deputy Roberts advised that when he stepped away with Driver 1's wife to get the insurance he advised her that she could be arrested for lying to the police to cover up for her husband's accident. Deputy Roberts advised that she stated ""Yeah, but you don't have to live with him.""Photographs were taken of the damage to both vehicles and placed into evidence. There were several gouges and dents as well as black transfer, from the bumper of Driver 2's vehicle, on the rear passenger door, quarter panel, and rear bumper of Vehicle 1. Vehicle 2 had minor damage to the driver's side front bumper.Due to the vehicles being moved a diagram was not completed."

The location of the crash was Indiana State Road 37 northbound, approximately one half mile north of the ramps for Monroe Dam road. State Road 37 in this area is a asphalt 4-lane divided highway, that runs primarily north-south, connecting the cities of Bloomington to the north with Bedford to the south. It has a shoulder approximately one vehicle wide bordering the outside lane and has painted lane control devices. The road surface at this time was dry, and the sky was cloudy, with normal low light nighttime conditions. Traffic was moderate at the time of the collision. When I arrived, I observed a gray Dodge Charger unmarked police vehicle bearing Indiana passenger plates 340NTB pulled into the highway crossover located at approximately 8787 IN 37, Bloomington, IN 47403.

At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the road surface was dry. M/Trp. Clephane was told the crash was near the grocery entrance of Walmart. Upon my arrival, there were two ambulances at the grocery entrance, and they were transporting a subject for a medical issue with no crash involved. Observing no crash, M/Trp. Clephane advised radio and left. A short time later, radio advised the crash actually being located in row 10 of the parking lot and that one vehicle had left the scene of the crash. Vehicle 1, red 2019 Chevrolet Spark, bearing Illinois temporary plate 669U162 which had expired on 6/12/2019 was making a U-turn through parking slots and in between parked cars, west of row 10. Vehicle 2, red 2015 Toyota Sienna min-van, bearing Indiana registration RNE284 is going straight south in Row 10 of the Walmart Parking Lot. As V-2 traveled south in Row 10, V-1 made a U-turn through empty parking spaces between parked cars, and as V-1 was finishing his U-turn between parked cars, the front left of V-1 struck the right side of V-2.After the crash, both vehicles backed into empty parking spaces and both drivers got out of their respective vehicles. Driver 2 Elizabeth Byrge, stated that Driver 1 Anton Cowens made the statement that the vehicle was his girlfriend's car. Cowens then left the vehicles and ran inside Walmart through the Grocery Entrance. Cowens went straight to the Customer Service Desk where he spoke with a black female, who was up at the register attempting to return some items. Cowens makes a brief statement to the female, Zeshawn Lewis who is the registered owner of the car, and then Cowen leaves running back out of Walmart. Cowens returns to the where the crashed cars are parked and goes around the passenger side of Vehicle 2 with Elizabeth Byrge to observe the damage. Cowens then walks around the vehicle and over to his girlfriends' vehicle where Cowens gets in and drives away leaving the Walmart lot towards Liberty Drive.Driver 1, Elizabeth Byrge stated that Driver 1 was wearing a blue polo shirt, black male, with his hair cut short. Byrge stated that the male driver told her he was driving his girlfriend's vehicle. Byrge was able to provide the temporary Illinois license plate number for V-1 being 669U162. This unit then contacted Bloomington Post and had them run the information through IDACS and then through the Illinois Authorities and was able to obtain that the vehicle was owned and registered to Zeshawn Lewis, had been purchased at Kingdom Chevrolet Inc., and had an expired temporary plate which had expired on 6-19-2019. Bloomington Radio was able to further advise that Zeshawn Lewis had a date of birth of 10/10/1996. This unit then met with Walmart Loss Prevention Specialist Chad Otto and we reviewed multiple cameras and transactions involved in this incident. Video of the crash and it's aftermath as described above if captured on video. Also not mentioned earlier, when Lewis' return is declined, Walmart's system did not keep her identifying information, however she is still on the video. When Lewis leaves Walmart, after having Cowens come in and speak to her basically in her ear, Lewis leaves by means of going out of the Pharmacy side exit and walks completely out of the camera ranges in the parking lot walking toward the back side of Sam's.This unit continued to investigate and was able to obtain contact numbers for Lewis' parents in Chicago and spoke with them by telephone. Lewis's father said that his daughter had ""taken a bad turn"" and that she was staying with what he called at first a clown, then corrected himself and stated Cowens. Mr. Lewis stated that he would contact his wife, Betty Lewis, and she might have further. A short time later, Betty Lewis called the Post and informed t"

At the time of the crash the weather was clear and the roadway was dry.Vehicle#1 (Red 2006 Lexis) was stopped perpendicular (facing east) in the southbound lanes of Interstate 69 near the 109.2 mile marker. Driver#1 had previously crashed into a guardrail and came to final rest in the middle of Interstate 69. Vehicle#2 (2002 Pink Peterbilt) was traveling southbound in the right lane and struck Vehicle#1 in the driver's side rear. This action caused Vehicle#1 to rotate counterclockwise and come to a final rest against the median side guardrail, facing north. Vehicle#2 lost control and continued southbound, leaving tire marks on the roadway in the right lane. Vehicle#2 traveled to the left and struck the median guardrail at the Harmony Road overpass. Vehicle#2 continued through the median in a southeasterly direction and struck the northbound side guardrail median. Vehicle#2 then crossed the northbound lanes of Interstate 69, overturned and traveled down an embankment and came to final rest on its passenger's side off the roadway, facing southeast.

This roadway is State Road 48 immediately west of the area of impact and 3rd Street at the area of impact. State Road 48 / 3rd Street is a multi-lane road that has a raised concrete curb in parts and double yellow dividing line in other areas. There are two lanes of travel for westbound traffic and two lanes of travel for eastbound traffic. The eastbound portion of the roadway at the crash site has two through lanes to travel eastbound on 3rd Street into Bloomington and two dedicated turn lanes to proceed northbound on Interstate 69. Environmental conditions at the time of the crash were clear, dry, no precipitation and approximately 71 degrees (according to a temperature gauge in my issued police vehicle). The time frame of this crash was at sunset and the position of the setting sun was in the line of sight for traffic proceeding westbound on 3rd Street.Vehicle 1, a white 2016 Dodge Charger, is a fully marked Indiana State Police commission. Vehicle 1 was facing eastbound on State Road 48 (also known as 3rd Street at the crash site) in the right most dedicated turn to proceed northbound on Interstate 69. Vehicle 1 started the process of turning from eastbound State Road 48 to northbound Interstate 69. Vehicle 1 was struck in the passenger rear door by the front of Vehicle 2. Vehicle 1 rotated approximately 90 degrees in a clockwise manner and came to rest facing eastbound in the right lane of westbound 3rd Street.Vehicle 2, a white 1993 GMC Sonoma, was westbound on 3rd Street. Vehicle 2 continued into the intersection where traffic eastbound on State Road 48 (3rd Street) makes a turn to proceed northbound on Interstate 69. The front of Vehicle 2 struck the passenger rear door of Vehicle 1.Driver 1 stated that he was at a complete stop facing eastbound on State Road 48 at an automatic signal. Driver 1 said that his dedicated turn indicator was red and that is why he was stopped. Driver 1 stated that his dedicated turn indicator changed from red to green and he began to make his turn to proceed northbound on Interstate 69. Driver 1 said that he then observed that Vehicle 2 did not appear to be stopping and he accelerated more in an attempt to avoid a collision. Driver 1 stated that the front of Vehicle 2 struck the rear passenger door area of Vehicle 1.Driver 2 stated that he was westbound on 3rd Street travelling approximately 30 to 35 mph. Driver 2 said that he could not see the automatic signal indicators due to the glare of the setting sun. Driver 2 stated that when he observed Vehicle 1 making its turn, he applied his brakes but was unable to stop in time. Driver 2 said that Vehicle 2 then struck Vehicle 1.Evidence at the scene included fresh tire marks in the left lane of westbound 3rd St. The tire marks began near the white stop line for westbound 3rd Street and continued to the area of impact between Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 2. These tire marks were consistent with a braking maneuver and consistent with the statement of Driver 2. I measured these tire marks to 41 feet 0 inches. I also observed tire marks that began near the area of impact and lead to the final rest of Vehicle 1. These marks were consistent with Vehicle 1 rotating after impact. The reported path of travel for Vehicle 1 from the white stop line of the right most dedicated turn lane on State Road 48 (3rd Street) eastbound to the area of impact was measured to be 56 feet 8 inches.The left lane of westbound 3rd Street, the lane of travel for Vehicle 2, is newer asphalt with some normal wear from vehicular traffic. I utilized a coefficient of friction scale provided by Trimble Forensics Reveal software in order to provide a speed determination range for Vehicle 2. Based on my observation of the roadway at the scene and the statement of Driver 2, I used a coefficient of friction range of .55 to 1.2. Using this information and the measured brake mark of Vehicle 2, a speed range for Vehicle 2 was"

Upon arrival I spoke with the complainant Donald Dixon. Dixon advised he was notified by a co-worker his vehicle, a Gray Ford Fusion with plate XNW590, was possibly involved in an accident. Dixon then said he went to check since he was working in the Geology building at the time of the accident.Dixon said his vehicle a gray 2012 Ford Fusion was parked stationary and the vehicle was unoccupied on the east side of Walnut Grove facing northbound. Dixon's vehicle was also parked in an area marked no parking. Dixon said he was told they were allowed to park there since they were doing construction in the Geology Building. Dixon said his friend he identified as Douglas McCracken was doing work on the third floor and told Dixon his vehicle may have been involved in an accident and the vehicle left the scene. I then asked Dixon if he would be able to contact McCracken to have him come down and speak with me. Dixon called McCracken on the phone and he came downstairs to speak with me regarding what occurred. McCracken arrived downstairs where the accident occurred. I informed McCracken I was wanting to get a recorded statement on what he witnessed. McCracken said he was walking down the stairs in the Geology Building and observed a black in color Mercedes Benz appearing have a difficult time trying to park or leave. McCracken said he noticed it was a co-worker Donald (D.J.) Dixon's car. McCracken said when he noticed it was Dixon's vehicle he pulled out his phone and took a couple pictures and video. McCracken said he noticed Dixon's vehicle move forward slightly where McCracken felt the Mercedes definitely made contact with the Fusion. McCracken said the Mercedes Benz appeared to have struck Dixon's Ford Fusion on the rear driver side bumper with the front passenger side panel of the Mercedes. McCracken said the Mercedes then left the area, and drove around the corner to the parking lot just north of the location for the Multi Science Building located at 702 N. Walnut Grove. McCracken said Dixon was able to locate the vehicle. McCracken said after notifying Dixon he went back to work until Dixon called him to speak with me. McCracken then emailed me the photos. I viewed the photos on scene where it shows the Mercedes being close to the Ford, and the video shows the vehicle only driving off, not the actual crash that occurred. After speaking with McCracken I spoke with the owner and victim of the Ford Fusion Dixon who also gave a taped statement. Dixon said he was at work and his buddy McCracken was looking out the window and observed a Black Mercedes back into his vehicle. Dixon said after speaking with McCracken he went downstairs to see if the Mercedes struck his vehicle. Dixon said he observed the vehicle park. Dixon said he went and took pictures of the damage on the Mercedes and the license plate for the Mercedes being Pet Friendly PL5489. Dixon described the driver of the vehicle who he saw at a distance being a Asian male, 5'8, wearing black hoody, and black pants, and carrying a backpack. Dixon said he then called police to make a report. After speaking with Dixon and McCracken they took me to the parking lot to show me where the vehicle had parked. Both said the vehicle was parked in the third row. Upon getting to the area the vehicle was no longer there. I then made contact with Officer Smolen also with IUPD to have him meet me on scene due to having camera issues. I was able to photograph the scene and Dixon vehicle where the damage was located. I then made contact with IUPD Dispatch with the information provided by Dixon on the Mercedes. Dispatch advised they located the phone number and an off campus address. I called the phone number provided and the call went to voicemail with not being able to leave a message. Officer Smolen and I then drove the area and was unable to locate the vehicle. Office"

V3 drove over the curb raised median with a grass center, across the northwest lanes of travel, over another curb and off the roadway. Once off the roadway, V3 rolled down a steep hill into a ditch lined with rocks, through approximately 130 feet of grass, into bushes, and finally struck the IU Foundation building (1500 State Rd 46).V1 sustained damage across the rear bumper. V2 sustained heavy front end damage and damage across the rear. V3 sustained heavy front end damage and damage to the underbody.

Tower Ridge Rd is a narrow two lane gravel roadway that runs primarily east to west. The area of this collision occurred at the exit of a right hand curve in a slight downward grade.V1, red GMC, was traveling west on Tower Ridge Road. V1 traveled off the south side of the roadway and began to rotate in a clockwise direction. V1 continued to rotate and travel west along the south side of the roadway. V1 struck a tree along the driver's side just behind the cab. V1 then changed rotation and began to rotate in a counterclockwise direction as it continued west. V1 came to final rest along the south side of the roadway parallel to a dry creek bed facing to the north. I arrived on scene to find V1 abandoned with the doors locked. I observed significant damage to the bed along the driver's side just behind the cab. The rear axle was broken with both rear tires deflated. The front passenger tire was deflated. The front driver's tire was the only tire inflated. The driveshaft was lying along the south side of the roadway near the front of V1. The tailgate from V1 was lying along the south side of the roadway west of the dry creek bed. I walked to the east of V1 and observed what appeared to be the area of impact involving a tree along the south side of the roadway. I observed yaw marks in the gravel leading to the tree. I observed fresh scrape marks on the tree consistent with an impact by V1. I observed a single GMC center cap lying just behind the tree with the scrape marks. V1 had the same center caps. The driver's side rear wheel was the only wheel missing a center cap. D1, Mitchell, arrived as I was photographing the scene. D1 stated he had been traveling west on Tower Ridge Rd. D1 stated he believed the front passenger tire went flat which caused him to lose control of V1. D1 stated he began to slide on the gravel before striking a tree. D1 stated he obtained a ride after the collision due to poor cell signal and returned with his father. V1 was occupied by a single passenger who as also present with D1. The passenger identified himself with an Arizona Driver's license as August Nicholas Acosta, DOB 10-13-1997, OLN D10878338. Neither D1 nor Acosta complained of injury. Evidence shows significant damage to the front driver's side portion of the cargo bed consistent with the area of impact involving the tree. Evidence shows D1 failed to maintain lane and traveled off the south side of the roadway before striking the tree. It is not clear if the front passenger tire became deflated prior to the collision with the tree or after impact. V1 traveled approximately 62 feet west from the area of impact to final rest. The tailgate was approximately123 feet west of the area of impact. Evidence shows the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from D1's person during the accident investigation. D1 indicated he consumed alcoholic beverages prior to the collision. A PBT was administered at approximately 1930 hours with a positive result of .074% BrAC."

D2 stated that on 10/01/2019 at approximately 1600 hours, she noticed her vehicle had heavy damage to the bumper on the passenger side. D2 stated she was not in the car at the time of the accident. I viewed camera footage provided by a resident of 928 E. 3rd Street that showed D1 backing into V2 traveling south. The footage showed V2 leaving the scene of the crash headed north in the parking lot. That footage will be attached to the case. I met with D1 on station and through my investigation determined that D1 did not know he was involved in a crash. D1 stated he had backed up in the parking lot but did not realize that he had hit V2. I looked at V1 and did not notice any damage to the vehicle. Because D1 did not realize he had been in a crash, he did not know what happened.

I responded to a crash on Ramp D 100 SR37, which is a ramp from both east and west lanes of SR 48, also known as 3rd Street West, Bloomington, Monroe County, Indiana. The ramp is a curve and descending grade to the south. At the top of the ramp is a y-junction, where eastbound traffic turning south onto the ramp to I69 south must yield to traffic entering the ramp from the westbound left turn lane. The road is asphalt with painted lane control and a yield sign in this area. At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the road surface was dry. The vehicles were still driveable and had moved from the ramp further south onto I69 and were pulled over on the shoulder approximately 50 feet south of where the merging lane terminates into the right lane of I69 southbound. Vehicle 1, (V1) a 1997 camouflage (primarily green) painted S10 pickup truck bearing Indiana plates BKA436 and driven by Rebekah Mathis (DOB: 11/02/2001) was stopped on the shoulder behind Vehicle 2 (V2) and displayed damage to the right front bumper, which was hanging off on the ground.. V2 was a 2019 white Volkswagen beetle bearing Indiana plates 907ZZG and driven by Ana Hernandez (DOB: 08/32/1994) and displayed damage to the rear bumper and left rear quarter panel, with green paint transfer. Both drivers gave a concurrent statements, which were identical; namely, that V2 was merging from SR48 eastbound onto the ramp to I69 south, when it encountered a vehicle coming down the ramp having turned from the left turn lane of SR 48 westbound. V2 braked (in accordance with the yield sign, which faces traffic coming from SR 48 eastbound) and V1 failed to stop in time to avoid a collision. V1 swerved left to try to avoid V2 but was unable to avoid a collision. After the collision, both parties removed their vehicles to the shoulder of I69 southbound and called 911. Both drivers were uninjured and stated that they did not require medical attention. D1 used a knife and pliers to remove the portion of the front bumper that was hanging down on the ground. Both vehicles were still driveable and were removed from the scene under their own power. There were no witnesses to the collision that remained on scene. Based on the statements of the drivers, the evidence visible during the accident investigation, it is my opinion that the following likely occurred: V2 was approaching the Y-intersection at the top of the ramp when it encountered another exiting driver, and braked to allow it to pass. V1 was following too closely or was not aware of V2 braking and collided with the rear bumper. As such, driver 1 (Mathis) is at fault for the collision."

William's said the Altima began merging over where he was getting closer to the curb. William's said the Altima then was in his lane of travel in front of him. Williams said he thought the Altima might have struck his vehicle, but was not sure at the time.William's said he then began following the Altima where it got into the turn lane after changing lanes a few times turning east onto Third Street. William's said during this time he was on the phone calling police, which he was talking to Central Dispatch. William's said during this time he was asked if he was following the vehicle and he replied yes. William's said he then observed the female driver pull into a gas station off east Third Street. I asked William's which one. William's said he believed it was the Speedway at E. Third Street and Kingston Drive. William's said he pulled into the Kmart parking lot to turn around and sat there for a minute. William's said he then made it over to where the Altima was parked, and sat directly behind the vehicle. Williams said the driver was a white female, approximately 20-25 years of age, blonde hair, with a black coat and possibly red glasses exit the Altima. William's said he observed the female on the phone, and thought she was calling police as well. I asked William's why he didn't get out of the vehicle and speak with the driver. William's said he did not know at the time if the Altima had actually struck his vehicle because he did not feel the vehicle's collide. William's also said he did not want to get into an argument with the other driver. William's said he was also waiting on the police to arrive. William's said after waiting a reasonable amount of time for the police to respond, and the female driver of the other vehicle leaving he went back home. William's said he did not notice the minor damage to his vehicle right front fender quarter panel until he got home yesterday late afternoon. William's then told me he just wants the lady to pay for the damage to his vehicle. William's said that he was going to continue to look for the vehicle, and if located going to call the police to come out. While speaking with William's, I conducted a vehicle registration check for the Nissan Altima through IUPD dispatch. I was informed the plate information given by William's returned to a 2014 Chevrolet Cruze out of Michigan instead of the Nissan Altima he described. I then requested IUPD dispatch to contact IU Parking Operations to see if there was any vehicles with a parking permit registered to the vehicle. IUPD Dispatch advised Parking Operations did not have a vehicle with the Michigan plate CBV3560 assigned to any type of parking permit. IUPD Dispatched when requested also advised the registered owner of the vehicle is not a registered student or employee affiliated with Indiana University.I then took photographs of the minor damage to front right quarter panel on the Jetta. After speaking with William's, I drove to the Speedway gas station and spoke with the District Manager Angel Harris. I explained to Harris why I was there and if we could view the video footage. Harris said yes. During this time we viewed cameras 12 (Pumps) and 6 (Dispenser) from 1500-1700 hours"

B1 believes V1 did stop at the posted stop sign. B1 stated he was unable to stop in time and collided with the front, driver side quarter panel of V1. The impact caused him to go up onto the hood of V1. B1 and D1 talked briefly and exchanged basic information. B1 stated that his lower right leg became sore after the collision and he went to the hospital for X-Rays. B1 also stated that his bicycle is badly damaged, and along with the medical expenses, wanted to make a report.I then contacted D1 over the telephone who stated he had left Bloomington and would not be back for several days. D1 stated that he was attempting to turn out of the drive and turn eastbound onto 3rd Street. He stated he looked both ways, but did not see B1 approaching from the east.

Deputy Ruiz informed me that V1 was in the West bound lane to continue West on W.

I observed tire marks leading up to V1 consistent with running off the roadway. V1 was wedged up against a guard rail. I observed damage to the windshield and rear view mirror consistent with the driver striking the windshield. There was a significant amount of blood in that area of the dash and leading out of the passenger side of the vehicle. There was also an odor of an alcoholic beverage in the vehicle. I also observed blood on the guard rail on the west side of the roadway consistent with someone climbing over the guard rail. I also observed blood on the ground on the west side of the guard rail leading away from the crash. Adrianna, who stated she was driving, had injuries from the crash but not consistent with hitting the windshield and mirror. Adrianna declined medical transport on scene. Alexis Miller was the other passenger in V1 at the time of the crash. Alexis stated she was asleep and didn't know what happened and that she, Trai, and Adrianna were the only people in V1 at the time of the crash. Trai Ervine was also a passenger in V1 during the crash and was not injured. Trai stated he didn't know what happened since he was asleep. Trai also stated he didn't know who was driving since he was asleep. Adrianna later stated at the ED that Trentin M Hollin, DOB 11/4/2001, was the individual who fled the scene. Trai and Alexis both had different stories about where they were in the vehicle at the time of the crash. Alexis Miller was intoxicated and pbt. Result was .17. all 3 were transported via patrol car to the ED so Alexis could be checked out for alcohol consumption since she was a juvenile. Adrianna was given a pbt the result was .00. V1 was towed due to disabling damage.Once at the ED Adrianna decided to be seen for neck pain. Adrianna also provided information that led to locating Trentin in a wooded area near the scene. Once Trentin was located I observed injuries to his face and nose area consistent with striking the windshield above the steering wheel. I did observe the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating form his exhaled breath. Trentin was transported to the ED due to his injuries from the crash. Trentin stated he wasn't driving the vehicle. I advised him he was the only occupant with injuries consistent with striking the windshield on the drivers side of the vehicle. A search warrant was obtained for a blood draw and executed at the IU Health ED. Evidence was also collected form the vehicle and submitted to the state lab. Also located in the vehicle was a small amount of what I believe to be Marijuana under the drivers seat. Trentin was left at the ED to be treated for his injuries and left in the custody of his mother and step father. Due to Trentin's injuries, the lack of injuries to Adrianna, and the damage to the drivers side windshield it appears Trentin is D1."

Driver 2 (D2) advised that he was heading southbound on S Muller Parkway and was attempting to make a left handed turn at the t-intersection. D2 reported that the bus had been stopped at the stop sign and began making the turn at about the same time that he did. D2 advised that as V1 was making the turn that had had to stop because he could see that the vehicles were going to make contact. D2 stated that he stopped, but advised that the bus kept moving forward and made contact with the rear driver's side of his vehicle. Witness (W1) was on the bus at the time of the accident. W1 advised that as the bus was pulliing out that V2 quickly attempted to make the turn around the bus. W1 stated that D1 stopped the bus because the vehicles were so close together. W1 reported that V2 continued going forward and struck the rear end of the bus. It should be noted that Chandler's towing was called on scene due to both vehicles still making contact with one another. Chandler's winched the rear end of V2 so that the vehicles were no longer making contact. D2 paid for Chandler's services. Both vehicles drove away from the scene."

I arrived at around 22:20 and observed a silver GMC Acadia parked on the right side of the roads with its flashers activated, leaking fluids heavily. A debris field was scattered across the highway to the north of where the vehicle was stopped. The highway in this area is a primarily north-south 4-lane divided highway, that connects the cities of Bloomington and Bedford, with a grassy center median. The road surface is asphalt, newly repaved, and at this time was dry and clear of any foreign substances. The lighting was dark due to time of day, with no natural illumination, and the weather was approximately 40 degrees Fahrenheit. The road has painted lane control and shoulders on both inner and outer sides, and is equipped with rumble strips (lane departure warning system). Vehicle 1 was a GMC Silver 2017 Acadia, bearing Indiana In God We Trust plates AAF784, driven by and registered to Bryan Staggs (DOB: 03/30/1984). The vehicle displayed massive front end damage, as well as damage to the undercarriage, both front quarter panels, and the hood. The driver's side door would not open and the vehicle had lost all of its fluids on the road. The driver stated that he was driving southbound on SR 37, in the left lane, just south of the junction of Smithville Road, when a large buck (male deer) jumped in front of his vehicle from the east (median). With no time to react he instantly collided with the deer. He then braked heavily and came to a controlled stop on the right shoulder of the road. He advised that neither him nor his female passenger were injured, and refused treatment.An investigation of the area showed marks consistent with striking the deer approxiately 100 meters north of where the vehicle came to rest on the west shoulder of the highway. A dead male deer was located in the center grassy median, showing marks consistent with having been struck by a vehicle. The driver phoned Mikel's towing in Bedford to remove his vehicle, which was non-drivable, from the edge of the highway. Based upon the evidence at the scene, It is likely that the following occurred: While driving southbound on SR37, a deer ran into the roadway, causing an unavoidable collision. As such, the driver is not at fault."

D1 left the scene of the initial accident, however due to the damage on the vehicle, it was evident that D1 had attempted to change into the left lane, hitting V2. I first spoke to D2 who stated that she was driving westbound on 3rd Street in the left lane going straight. She stated she had just been starting into traffic on a green light when the accident occurred. D2 stated that as she was passing V1 in the left lane, she noticed it appeared to have its turn signal on as though it was going to make a lane change. It was at this time that she realized V1 changed lanes, suddenly striking V2. I spoke to W1 who stated he works at Bear's Place. He stated that he was walking behind Bear's Place when the accident occurred. W1 stated he heard the accident as it was loud, he then went out to the roadway to make sure there were no injuries, and when he did, he witnessed D1 leave the scene. W1 stated he saw D1 get out of his car (which he noticed was a Mercedes Sprinter Van) and ask D2 if she was okay. He then saw D1 attempt to pick up debris from the accident. At this time, W1 lost sight of D1 as he was helping D2 get the vehicle out of the roadway. He then went to see where D1went and he noticed that D1 had left the scene, driven 1 block west turning left onto Highland. He saw that D1 had parked V1 in a spot off Highland, and at this time, he saw D1 driving southbound on some type of moped or scooter. D2 did not sustain injuries, however her vehicle was towed due to disabling damage.On 11/2/19 D1 came to IUPD to attempt to get his vehicle. I was able to get his information at this time, and at 2005 hours, I had D1 meet me at IUPD to speak with him about the incident the night before. D1 stated that he is from Elkhart, IN and was just in town for parent's weekend for his daughter's sorority. He stated the vehicle is a work vehicle, as he works for Midwest Automotive Designs, and he had planned to use it to drive his daughter around for the weekend. D1 stated he had been driving in the left lane, westbound on 3rd Street, near 3rd and Jordan. D1 stated he had planned to turn left just past the intersection to turn into the Village Pantry parking lot. D1 stated he had his turn signal on, and just after the intersection, he turned left to turn into the lot. When he did, all of a sudden, V2 ""came out of nowhere"" and the vehicles collided. Sullivan stated he believed that D2 ran into him initially. D1 then stated he got out of the vehicle and went over to D2, asking if she was okay. When she said she was okay, he then left and drove one block west to Highland and parked his vehicle on the side of the road. D1 then walked back to the initial crash scene but did not see D2 anywhere. He stated he had seen the bystanders helping her move her car out of the roadway, but he thought she had left as he no longer saw her. D1 stated he then went back to the van realizing his phone was dead. At this time, he grabbed a motorized scooter he had in his van, and decided he could drive it back to his hotel. D1 stated he went back to Village Pantry one final time looking for D2 but when he couldn't find her a second time, he then left. D2 remained in the area of the crash the entire time. At no time did D1 attempt to ask bystanders to use their phone to call police nor did he ask bystanders if they knew where D2 had gone. D1 also could not explain why there was no plate on V1. D1 stated he did not remove any plate from the vehicle. V1 is not a registered vehicle through Indiana, however I was given a dealer license plate and insurance information from Midwest Automotive Designs. The plate given that may or may not have been on the vehicle was Indiana Dealer plate 5740C. It is still unclear if there was ever a plate on the vehicle or if it was removed.

D1 stated he wanted to turn northbound onto the bypass and was inching forward trying to make sure there was no oncoming traffic. He stated he did not see P1 until he was right in front of him. D1 stated P1 was just north of the crosswalk when he struck him and immediately came to a stop. D1 stated his finger was bleeding and refused an ambulance. D1 stated he had a prior, minor cut on his finger and that he gripped the steering wheel so hard during the collision that it opened back up. V1 sustained damage to the windshield and the hood of the car. The windshield was shattered and had a hole on the driver's side where P1 had landed.

I arrived on scene and observed a Green Jeep Cherokee with Indiana License Plate WPS291 wrecked just south of E North Drive. The license plate returned to a Donald L. Drake JR. The Jeep was unoccupied and appeared to have struck a nearby tree resulting in heavy front end damage to the front passenger side and damage to the tree. There was also a bumper and various pieces of car lights on the base of the tree from the Jeep. The keys were also in the ignition and appeared to be turned into the engine on position, however, the Jeep was not running. I observed marks on the road, curb, and grass that indicated the car was possibly driving west bound on E North Drive before going over the curb sideways or at an angle (4 different tire marks n grass/rubber marks on curb) before striking the tree. Because the vehicle was abandoned and heavily damaged I requested a tow truck to remove the vehicle. While I was waiting for the Chandler's Towing, a burglary in progress was dispatched at 772 E RIDGE CREST CT which is not very far to the east of where this accident occurred. The male subject in the burglary was described as a male in a red shirt. I was then told over the radio that this male would be the subject from the accident that had left the scene. Officer Owen met with the Jeep and Chandler's towing to complete an inventory and Tow form while I met with Officers on Ridge Crest Court. When I arrived the male in the red shirt, later identified by his Indiana License as Donald Lee Drake III, was already detained in handcuffs as he had been possibly attempting to burglarize the residence. When I had contact with Drake I could smell the odor of alcoholic beverage on his exhaled breath, I observed watery and glossy eyes, and Drake's speech was slurred and at times incoherent. Drake also had numerous cuts and scrapes to his knees and head, including a bloody nose. There was also mud on his shoes and legs. Based on what I observed at the crash, Drake's state of being, and his proximity to the crash, I read Drake his Miranda Warning to which he said he understood his rights and would speak with me. Drake advised he did not remember being in crash but when asked again if anyone else was in the car with him he said no and when asked if he was the only one in the vehicle Drake said yes. I asked Drake when the last time he drank alcohol was and he advised a few hours ago (from 0100 hours when questioned). Drake did not initially elaborate on what type of alcohol, though. Because of the nature of the accident I did not perform standard field sobriety tests because it was unclear if he may have had any underlying injuries, therefore I decided I would also take him to the Hospital. Based on Drake admitting to being the only occupant of the car, advising the Green Jeep was his car, leaving the scene without properly notifying any police department, admitting to consuming alcoholic beverages, having alcoholic beverage odor emitting off his person and exhaled breath, slurred and incoherent speech, and watery and glossy eyes, I had probable cause to believe Drake operated a vehicle while intoxicated. I read Drake Indiana Implied Consent to which he said he understood and would submit to a chemical test (Blood Draw). I transported Drake to IU Health Bloomington, removed the handcuffs from Drake, and read over the consent form with him to make sure he understood. Drake and I then both signed the form. Drake's Blood was taken and placed into an Indiana Department of Toxicology kit vials on 11/06/2019 at 0149 hours. I labeled and sealed the kit. In speaking with Drake I asked him what type of alcohol he consumed tonight and he advised it was a mixture of Beer and Whiskey/Liquor. Drake underwent many more tests including a cat scan before being medically released. While at the hospital Drake"

D2 stated he was about halfway through his turn when he felt an impact on the right side of V2 and thought he had hit a curb. Instead, he realized that V1 had been in his blind-spot on his right side and V1 and V2 collided. V2 sustained damage to the right side. The front passenger's side door was scratched and dented in and the front passenger's side wheel was also scratched. The back passenger's side door was also damaged with scratches and part of the door was bent outward.D1 stated he was driving eastbound on 17th Street approaching Walnut Grove. D1 stated that the road was wide enough for two lanes of travel going eastbound and thought he was in the ""right lane"" on 17th Street. D1 stated he was going faster than D2 was and was going to pass. He then saw that V2 had it's turn signal on to turn south onto Walnut Grove and he did not have time to get out of the way. 17th Street going eastbound only has one lane of eastbound travel. The lane for eastbound traffic is oversized, however, there are no painted lines indicating that there are two eastbound lanes. V1 sustained damage to the front driver's side.

SR37 is a four lane two way highway that runs primarily north and south. The Victor Pike intersection is ran by a fully operational traffic light. At the time of the crash, the weather was sunny and clear but the road surface was snowy and icy. The traffic lights had snow on them from the the night before. Vehicle 1, a black Chrysler Pacific, was traveling south on SR37 at the Victor Pike intersection. Vehicle 2, a red Chevrolet Cruz, was turning left (south) onto SR37 from west bound Victor Pike. V1 struck the rear end of V2. V1 spun out of control and ended up in the ditch to the southwest of the intersection. V2 was able to come to a controlled stop on the west side shoulder of SR37 just south on the intersection. Driver 1, Brenda Chipman, told me she was driving south on SR37 approaching the Victor Pike intersection. D1 said she was holding her hand up to shield her eyes from the sun as she approached the intersection. D1 told me that she thought she had the green light to continue. D1 told me that while she was attempting to cross the intersection a semi truck crossed the intersection from the west side and turned north onto SR 37. D1 stated she had to maneuver around the semi in order not to hit it. After getting around the semi truck D1 told me that she struck the rear end of V2. D1 said she never saw V2 until she hit it. D1 told me after hitting V2, she spun out of control and ended up in the ditch towards the southwest corner of the intersection. Driver 2, Jacob Rose, told me he was turning south (left) onto SR37 from west bound Victor Pike. D2 said when the light turned green he turned left (south) onto SR37 as a semi truck turned north onto SR37 from the east bound Victor Pike side of SR37 intersection. D2 said he had almost completed the transition from Victor Pike to SR37 when he suddenly felt his vehicle getting struck from behind. D2 told me that after he was stuck he pulled over to the side of the road and checked on V1, which was down in the ditch. Evidence shows minimal damage to the front side of V1.

SR 37 is four lane two way road that runs primarily north and south. The S. Victor Pike intersection is controlled by a fully operational four way traffic light. At the time of the crash, the weather was clear but the road surface was icy. Due to the previous nights snowfall the traffic light had a light cover snow on it. Vehicle 1, a brown Buick Enclave, was traveling south on SR 37 at the S Victor Pike intersection. Vehicle 2, a white Ford F-250, was turning north onto SR 37 from east bound S Victor Pike. As V1 was traveling south through the intersection it stuck the rear driver side of V2. V1 spun out of control and came to a stop facing northwest in the middle of south bound traffic in the intersection. V2 spun out of control, of the roadway, towards the southwest corner of the intersection. V2 ended up in the ditch pinned against a tree facing west.

I arrived at approximately 03:20 and found a 2020 white Chevrolet Traverse, bearing Sheriff's plates 8463. The driver, Kaden Reed SUTER, DOB: 03/19/1994, was uninjured. I69 in this area is a 6 lane divided highway that runs primarily north-south, is an asphalt-paved road with a wide outer shoulder, painted lane control, and rumble strips near the fog lines. The speed limit in this area is 70 miles per hour. The road condition was dry, the lighting was dark, with no artificial lighting in this area. A major feature of this area is Oliver Winery, which lies to the east side of the highway directly where the crash occurred. The vehicle displayed front end damage consistent with striking a deer. There was blood and bits of fur embedded within the front bumper, which also sustained damage. There was damage to front left quarter panel and the driver's door, which did not close properly. A large buck was found dead approximately 200 feet south of where the vehicle had come to a controlled stop on the right shoulder. The driver, who was a Morgan County Sheriff's deputy, denied medical treatment. He was administered a portable breath test at the scene, which registered .000% BrAC/210 litres of breath. After taking photos, I took a statement from the driver. The driver, SUTER, stated that he had been travelling northbound at approximately 70 miles per hour on I69 when a large deer had crossed the road from west to east. He had braked to avoid a collision but was unable to avoid striking the deer. He then brought the vehicle to a controlled stop on the right side of the road and called central dispatch to inform them that the collision had occurred. After completing my investigation, I departed the scene. The vehicle was still drivable and left the scene under its own power. All the above events occurred in Monroe County, Indiana."

Woodyard Road runs in a eastern and western direction and intersects with Curry Pike. There is a traffic control light at the intersection which was functioning properly when I arrived on scene.

No injuries were reported as a result of this crash. I attached a damage tag to the sign for repair.The crash investigation showed that the primary cause was Unsafe Speed on the part of D1.

At the time of the crash, the weather was cloudy and the road surface was dry. The power was out around most of the West side of Bloomington and as a result the traffic signals were also out so people were treating the instersections as a four way stop. All vehicles had been moved prior to this unit's arrival.Vehicle 1,a white Toyota was traveling East on SR 46 West of Arlington Road. Vehicle 2, a gold Pontiac was turning left from the bank parking lot at Arlington Road onto Westbound SR 46. V-2 had stopped at the intersection. As V-2 proceeded to make the turn V-1 came into the intersection without slowing down and the front of V-1 struck the left side of V-2 according to the only witness.Driver 1 stated that she was coming up to the intersection and the lights were out, however she did not see anyone at the intersection and therefore saw no reason to stop. Driver 2 informed me that he had stopped as the lights were out and when it was his turn, he pulled out and was struck in the driver's side by V-1.Shannon Poole, the only witness to this crash, told this officer that he was behind V-1 at the time of the crash. Poole stated that V-2 had been stopped at the intersection as he and V-1 approached, and that V-1 never even slowed down and certainly did not stop at the intersection. Poole agreed with the drivers and this unit's observation that the traffic control lights were out. The evidence in this crash indicates that the traffic control devices were not functioning, therefore all drivers should have treated the intersection as a four way stop. D-1 did not treat the intersection as a four way stop and also did not yield to V-2 as it turned left through the intersection thereby causing this crash."

As the ramp curved southwest, Vehicle 1 failed to negotiate the curve, drove through the painted divider, left the roadway damaging an INDOT exit sign and a speed limit sign, and continued to travel through the ditch for approximately 60 yards before coming to a rest due to disabling damage. Vehicle 1 was towed to Spencer at the driver's request.Driver 1, Justin Wiley, stated he was traveling southbound on I-69 nearing the 114 exit. Wiley stated his windshield was foggy and could not see the roadway, causing him to leave the roadway and drive into the ditch. Later, Wiley stated he attempted to change lanes too quickly, causing his vehicle to hydroplane on the wet roadway, which caused the vehicle to leave the roadway and travel through the ditch before coming to a rest.When I arrived on scene, Wiley and his female passengers were hysterical, agitated, and seemed confused. Both were checked on scene by paramedics but refused treatment. As I continued to speak with Wiley I became suspicious he was under the influence of illegal drugs. Wiley later admitted he had taken Suboxone earlier in the day and that he had a prescription for the medication. However Wiley could not produce a prescription for the medication. I read Wiley the Indiana Implied Consent Warning and he consented to a blood draw. The blood draw was conducted at IU Health Bloomington Hospital and the results of that test are currently pending."

It was raining and the roadway was wet at the time of the accident investigation. SR45 is a two lane two way asphalt State Road that runs primarily in a northeast / southwest direction. V1, maroon Ford, was traveling south on SR45 south of Martin Drive. V1 began to slide on the wet roadway as it exited the right hand curve. V1 slid across the northbound lane and struck an ATT utility pole along the south side of the roadway. V1 impacted the utility pole along the passenger side of the vehicle at the rear of the extended cab. D1 initially left the scene prior to law enforcement arrival. W1, Lee, stated they were traveling south on SR45 just after V1 struck the utility pole. W1 provided a digital image and license plate number for V1, TK409NSX. W1 stated V1 was occupied by two white males. W1 stated the driver was utilizing a cell phone after impact and spoke to ""Mark"" indicating he had a collision. W1 stated D1 and the passenger returned to the truck and left the scene along a gravel drive north of the crash scene. I checked the gravel drive described by W1 but was unable to locate V1. A records check identified the truck as a maroon 2003 Ford Ranger. The truck is registered to Mark Blevins, Morgantown, IN. I contacted Morgan County Dispatch by telephone and requested they contact officers from Morgantown PD to attempt to locate the vehicle. I was contacted by a Morgantown Officer at approximately 1225 hours. The officer advised he located the vehicle and driver. I spoke with a male subject who identified himself verbally as Zackery Blevins. Blevins stated he had been driving V1 when he lost control and struck a utility pole. Blevins identified the passenger as Dustyn Merriman. I instructed Blevins I would meet with him on Sunday, 12/01/2019.On Sunday, 12/01/2019, I traveled to 140 S. Morton Street, Morgantown and made contact with a white male who identified himself with an Indiana driver's license as Blevins. Blevins stated he was traveling south on SR45 along with Dustyn Merriman. Blevins stated an unknown dark colored van or SUV was traveling left of center as he entered the right hand curve. Blevins stated he swerved to the right to avoid the vehicle and the passenger side tires left the roadway. Blevins stated he lost control of V1 as he exited the corner and began to slide. Blevins stated he struck a utility pole along the south side of the road with the passenger side of V1. Blevins confirmed he did not contact law enforcement after the collision. Blevins stated he returned to Morgantown until he was contacted by Morgantown PD. Evidence shows damage to the passenger side rear corner of the cab of V1 consistent with an impact by a round pole. Evidence shows the utility pole was cracked in half from the collision. Evidence shows the roadway was wet during the accident investigation. D1, Blevins, was summoned into court for leaving the scene of a property crash accident."

AFTER THE ABRUPT RIGHT TURN INTO THE ADJACENT LANE VEHICLE 2 WAS UNABLE TO STOP OR AVOID THE COLLISION, DUE TO BOTH VEHICLES BEING NEARLY SIDE-BY-SIDE PRIOR TO THE LANE CHANGE. THIS CREATED THE CHAIN REACTION THAT LED TO BOTH VEHICLE'S 3 AND 4 TO COLLIDE IN A REAR END CRASH, WITH BOTH UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO SLOW OR AVOID THE COLLISION.

When I explained to her that Driver 2 had advised she just left her parking spot several spaces down and could not have been speeding, Driver 1 then changed the story stating Driver 2 was probably texting and asked that I check Driver 2's messages. She later stated that multiple male friends of Driver 2 showed up to comfort her after the accident and coached her through what to say. I asked her what evidence she had to support this and she did not have any. She advised she believed this probably happened."

D1 should have made sure that there was no oncoming traffic before making the left turn.17th St. is a local road that runs in a eastern and western direction through Monroe County. College Avenue is a local road that runs in a northern and southern direction and intersects with 17th St. 158ft east of the crash. The roadway condition was wet at the time of the crash.V1 (1993 green Jeep Cherokee) was attempting to enter onto 17th St. from the Circle K gas station lot. W1 was stopped in traffic and was letting V1 exit the lot. V1 traveled north in front of W1 and started into the westbound lane of 17th Street. V2 (2009 red Cadillac) was traveling westbound on 17th Street and was struck in the driver and rear passenger side door area by V1.D1 (Dezaray Christenberry) stated she was attempting to travel onto 17th Street to go westbound. D1 stated that W1 stopped and was waiving her out of the gas station lot. D1 stated she could not see V2 and traveled onto 17th Street and struck V2 on the driver side. She was wearing her seat belt.D2 (David Williams) stated he was traveling westbound on 17th Street when V1 struck his vehicle on the driver side front and rear door. He was wearing his seat belt.W1 (Allan Headley) stated he was traveling eastbound on 17th Street and was stopping in traffic. W1 stated he stopped far enough back from the vehicle that was stopped in front of him to let V1 exit the lot. He waived to V1 to exit, but stated D1 did not look to see if any vehicles were oncoming.During the course of my investigation, I observed damage to the driver side front and rear passenger door of V2. I observed new damage to the right front fender and bumper area of V1. V1 already had front end damage to the grill, and bumper area from a prior, unrelated crash. No injuries were reported as a result of this crash.The crash investigation showed that the primary cause of the crash is Failure To Yield Right Of Way on the part of D1. This was determined by both driver and witness statements and damage sustained to both vehicles."

Prior to my arrival at the crash scene, an ambulance (2164) had been driving by and saw the vehicles on the side of the road after the crash. EMS stated they stopped to ensure there were no injuries. They checked out both drivers and stated both refused treatment. I first spoke to D1 who stated that he had been driving northbound on Park attempting to cross 10th Street and continue north. He stated he did not see any stop signs indicating him to stop, so he kept driving northbound crossing the street, when all of a sudden the front end of V1 struck V2. I then spoke to D2 who stated she was driving westbound on 10th Street near the intersection of 10th and Park Ave. when all of a sudden she saw V1 drive out in front of V2. She stated she was unable to stop in time to avoid a collision from occurring. She stated that it was also difficult to see the road due to the rain and weather so that his reaction time to attempt to stop may have been slower than usual. D2 stated that she had specialized driving privileges due to a previous OWI offense, however, D2 was able to show me all the required documentation as well as proof that she was driving home from work at Chili's. Damage to the front end of both vehicles was severe. V2's airbag deployed. D2 initially stated she did not have any injuries, however, she stated that once the adrenaline wore off, she noticed her face was hurting due to the airbag deployment. After she cleared the scene, she advised she was going to the IU Health Bloomington Hospital to be seen. While speaking with D1 near V1, I noticed the odor of marijuana emanating from the vehicle. I then asked D1 how long ago he had smoked marijuana, and he stated two hours prior. I then performed SFST's on D1 to ensure that he was not impaired on drugs. I saw no signs of either drug or alcohol impairment after performing the tests. I then searched his vehicle and only a small amount of marijuana residue was found. D1 did not sustain any charges."

Vehicle 1 was exiting the Indiana University Athletics parking lot from Gate 11 located in the 800 Block of East State Road 45/46 Bypass and was intending to exit westbound onto the 45/46 bypass. Vehicle 1 was required to cross the two eastbound lanes to enter the center turn lane which had been set up to function as an extended acceleration/merge lane into the westbound lanes. However, at the time of the collision, the basketball game was not yet completed and therefore limited vehicle traffic was present, therefore law enforcement officers along the bypass were not yet actively directing vehicle traffic. Specifically at Gate 11, Deputy Bennett Dillon and Deputy Michael Ruiz had recently completed cone placement in preparation for post-game traffic and were not directing vehicle traffic.As vehicle 1 prepared to exit gate 11, it was following a white SUV that briefly stopped prior to crossing the eastbound lanes to travel west. Driver 1 later stated that he believed that Deputies were directing vehicle traffic and that when the white SUV proceeded it was doing so under law enforcement direction. As vehicle 1 followed the white SUV across the eastbound lanes toward the center merge lane, vehicle 1 came to a stop across both eastbound travel lanes. Vehicle 2 attempted to stop using maximum braking, however ultimately collided with the driver side front bumper, quarter panel, and wheel/tire assembly.The collision resulted in extensive front end damage and air bag deployment to vehicle 2 and extensive bumper and wheel damage to vehicle 1. Driver and passenger of vehicle 1 did not sustain any injuries during the collision. Driver 2 initially stated that she was uninjured, however later complained of mild head pain from striking the airbag during the collision. Driver 2 declined to be evaluated by an ambulance at the scene and stated she would consult her doctor if the pain did not subside. Driver 1 made private arrangements with a towing service and driver 2 requested the on-call towing service for the Sheriff's Office to transport the vehicle to Kia Motors in Bloomington, Indiana.
